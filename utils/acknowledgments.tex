First of all, I would like to thank Professor Huang Chu-Ren for his guidance, and all the support and kindness he gave me in these three years, ever since my first email. He not only believed in my topic, but he taught me new ways to think about words, meanings and concepts, language and cognition. Next, I would like to thank the department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies (CBS) who equipped me with a workspace, and never-ending answers to all my question regarding my PhD program. Thanks are due to PolyU as well, to all the friendly staff and students who make this university a great place for learning, especially the library. I want to highlight the Pao Yue-Kong Library and the helpful people who work there and supply us with a great space, workshops, a wide range of books and materials, and can grant requests so promptly whenever we suggest a purchase; truly invaluable. And I cannot leave out the lovely people who run the LibCafé. I must also thank the Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong, who funded this PhD program via the \textit{Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme}. Lastly, I want to thank the people of Hong Kong, who welcomed me to their intriguing city.

% I want to mention the friends 

As probably this is the end of my official journey as a student---\textit{official} because in reality we all know this path never ends---I want to mention my teachers and professors who I learned so much from throughout these years, especially at my alma mater the Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE) in Budapest. The list is long, and I am grateful for all the knowledge, insight, and wisdom I received from everyone.

Most importantly, I want to thank my friends here who helped me all the way, especially Yun and Andreas, and of course my parents back home, who have always supported this life of study with patience.
