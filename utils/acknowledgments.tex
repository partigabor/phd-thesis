First, I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Chu-Ren Huang for his guidance and all the support and kindness he gave me in these three years, ever since my first email. He not only believed in my topic, but he taught me new ways to think about words, meanings, concepts, and language. Next, I would like to thank PolyU and the department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies (CBS) who equipped me with a workspace and never-ending answers to all my questions regarding my PhD program. I want to highlight the Pao Yue-Kong Library, the staff working there supplying us with space, workshops, a wide range of books and materials, and can grant requests so promptly whenever we suggest a purchase; truly helpful. I also cannot leave out the lovely people who run the LibCafé. I would like to express my gratitude to my two external examiners, Prof. Victor H. Mair and Prof. Baoya Chen, who took their time to read this work, gave invaluable comments, and encouraged me to continue on this path. I must also thank the Research Grants Council (RGC) of the University Grants Committee (UGC) of Hong Kong, who funded this PhD program under the Hong Kong Ph.D. Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS, ref. no. PF18-22990). Lastly, I want to thank the people of Hong Kong, who welcomed me to their intriguing city.

As probably this is the end of my \textit{official} journey as a student---\textit{official} because in reality we all know this path never ends---I want to thank all my teachers and professors who I learned so much from throughout these years, especially at my alma mater the Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE) in Budapest. Tamás Iványi, Zoltán Szombathy, Csaba Dezső, Mária Négyesi, the list is so long. I am grateful for all the knowledge, insight, and wisdom I received from everyone.

Most importantly, I want to thank my friends here who helped me all the way, especially Yun and Andreas, and of course my parents back home, who have always supported this life of study with patience.
