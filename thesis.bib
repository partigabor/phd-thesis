The history of Qarābādhīn starts from Chiron, Aesculapius, Hippocrates, Dioscorides and Galen in Greco-Roman era. Many of early and medieval Islamic and Arab physicians play vital role and immense original contribution in this discipline and authored important and essential Qarābādhīn with systemic and scientific approaches. Although some of them could not reach the present day, many of the manuscripts can be found in various libraries across the world. Since the Arab Caliphates appreciated and patronized the fields of medicine acquired from Greeks and worked for its development, this period also known as “Greco-Arabic era”. In this work the evaluation of Qarābādhīn (particularly written in Arabic or Greek language) was done in historical and regulatory perspective particularly in Greek era and later on in Medieval Islamic era. The findings of the review indicate the importance and regulatory status of Qarābādhīn and provide information about it. It can be helpful to explore Qarābādhīn and related publications of Greek and Medieval Islamic Arabic period, which gives foundations for the present-day pharmacopeias. Since these documents also take into account ethical considerations, its utility in the fields of medicine and medical ethics should be investigated.},

  abstract = {Deliciously organized by the Seven Deadly Sins, here is a scintillating history of forbidden foods through the ages--and how these mouth-watering taboos have defined cultures around the world. From the lusciously tempting fruit in the Garden of Eden to the divine foie gras, Stewart Lee Allen engagingly illustrates that when a pleasure as primal as eating is criminalized, there is often an astonishing tale to tell. Among the foods thought to encourage Lust, the love apple (now known as the tomato) was thought to possess demonic spirits until the nineteenth century. The Gluttony "course" invites the reader to an ancient Roman dinner party where nearly every dish served--from poppy-crusted rodents to "Trojan Pork"--Was considered a crime against the state. While the vice known as Sloth introduces the sad story of "The Lazy Root" (the potato), whose popularity in Ireland led British moralists to claim that the Great Famine was God's way of punishing the Irish for eating a food that bred degeneracy and idleness. Filled with incredible food history and the author's travels to many of these exotic locales, In the Devil's Garden also features recipes like the matzo-ball stews outlawed by the Spanish Inquisition and the forbidden "chocolate champagnes" of the Aztecs. This is truly a delectable book that will be consumed by food lovers, culinary historians, amateur anthropologists, and armchair travelers alike. Bon app?tit! From the Trade Paperback edition.},

You can use peppermint to settle an upset stomach, ease arthritis pain with stinging nettles, and heal burns and wounds with aloe vera. And then there is cannabis, perhaps the most notorious herb of all. Despite the fact that herbs are often little more than weeds, cultures around the globe have found hundreds of uses for them, employing them in everything from ancient medicines to savoury dishes. While much has been written on cooking and healing with herbs, little has been told about the history of the plants themselves and the incredible journeys they have made. These often overlooked plants have become a staple in our lives. Unlike spices that quickly traversed the globe through trade, herbs were often hoarded by their cultivators and were central to distinctive regional dishes. This book examines herbs in new ways, making it essential reading for any serious foodie. Filled with beautiful illustrations and delicious recipes, this book will complete the kitchen library."–Publisher description.},

The holy Quranic text was revealed in pure Classical Arabic, which forms the basis of Arabic linguistic theory and which is well understood by the educated Arabic reader. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the distributional lexical semantics of the Quran's words in the light of similar texts (corpus) that are written in pure Classical Arabic. To the best of our knowledge, there exist only two corpora of Classical Arabic one is part of the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology Arabic Corpus (KACST Arabic Corpus) and the other is the Classical Arabic Corpus (CAC) (Elewa, 2009). However, neither of the two corpora is adequate for our research the former does not cover many genres such as: Linguistics, Literature, Science, Sociology and Biography and it only contains 17+ million words, so it is not very large. While the latter is even smaller with only 5 million words. Therefore, we made an effort to carefully design and compose our own corpus bearing in mind that it should be large enough, balanced, and representative so that any result obtained from it can be generalized for Classical Arabic. In addition, we tried to make the design general enough in order to make the corpus also appropriate for other research.},

Yet these same officials gave official titles to Chinese pirates as part of a "summon and appease" (zhaofu) policy in the hope that the pirates would abandon crime for more civilized pursuits. After a decade of frustrations, the Dutch decided to take a page from the pirates' playbook and tried to unite the pirates to attack China. The pirate war against China did not go well for the Dutch, who failed to unite the pirates under their leadership. Nonetheless, they did eventually reach a modus vivendi with Chinese officials and began trading regularly with China. Yet after the collapse of the Ming Empire in 1644, the Dutch increasingly suffered competition from an ex-pirate organization: the powerful Zheng family. Its leader, Zheng Chenggong, created a loyalist state with maritime pretensions. So long as the company was competing against private Chinese seamen who lacked state support, it was able to hold its own. But once these seamen were united in the framework of a maritime Chinese state, the company could not prevail.]},

  abstract = {Taste is considered one of the lowest sensory modalities, and the most difficult to express in language. Recently, an increasing body of research in perception language and in Food Studies has been sparkling new interest and new perspectives on the importance of this sense. Merging anthropology, evolutionary physiology and philosophy, this book investigates the language of Taste in English, and its relationship with our embodied minds. In the first part of the book, the author explores the semantic dimensions of Taste terms with a usage-based approach. With the application of experimental protocols, Bagli enquires their possible organization in a radial network and calculates the Salience index of gustatory terms in both American and British English. The second part of the book is an overview of the metaphorical extensions that motivate the polysemy of Taste terms, with the aid of corpus analysis methods and various texts. This book is the first to review systematically and in a usage-based perspective the role of the sensory domain of Taste in English, showing a more complicated picture and suggesting that its under-representation and difficulty of encoding does not correspond to lack of importance.},

The book first summarizes some of the problems of grammatical description encountered from Saussure through the present and then outlines possibilities for new descriptions of language which take into account sociolinguistic factors. For instance, a static framework would view creole situations as "freak" situations and creoles as necessarily unstable and rapidly changing. A dynamic framework would endorse the Saussurian paradox that competence is looked for exclusively in the individual, but variety is sought in society. A dynamic framework would hold that competence is polylectal what language-users know about communicating with others more nearly represents their language competence than the subset of this knowledge exhibited in production. The bulk of the text centers around the enumeration of principles and the presentation of models for variation theory. A paper on feature marking and weighting is appended. (CAL/DB)},

  abstract = {We have discarded the old tongue map (sweet on the tip, etc.) for study of the interactions among taste nerves. Taste is mediated by the chorda tympani (anterior) and the glossopharyngeal (posterior) nerves. Unilateral anesthesia of the chorda tympani intensified some taste sensations from the area innervated by the contralateral glossopharyngeal. For some subjects, even with no stimulation, a phantom taste sensation appeared in the area innervated by the contralateral glossopharyngeal nerve. Thus when one taste nerve is damaged another compensates; however, the cost may be a taste phantom. Work on genetic variation in taste has identified supertasters of PROP (6-n-propylthiouracil) who are unusually sensitive to bitters and sweets as well as the burn from chili pepper (active ingredient capsaicin). Supertasters appear to have more tastebuds and since tastebuds have trigeminal neurons (mediating pain) associated with them, there is an association between perception of taste and irritation.},

  abstract = {Otitis media and tonsillectomy are associated with enhanced palatability of energy dense foods and with weight gain. Otitis media can damage the chorda tympani nerve (CN VII); tonsillectomy and head and neck radiation treatment can damage the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX). Both of these nerves function prominently in taste sensation. The present study utilizes these sources of damage to study central interactions among the nerves that mediate oral sensations. Mild damage restricted to one of these nerves can actually intensify sensations evoked from undamaged nerves (i.e., whole‐mouth taste, oral tactile sensations evoked by fats and irritants). These intensifications may result from disruption of central inhibitory taste circuits, as taste damage appears to disinhibit other oral sensory nerves. In addition, mild damage restricted to one taste nerve can intensify odors perceived from foods in the mouth during chewing and swallowing (i.e., retronasal olfaction); this may be a secondary consequence of the intensification of whole-mouth taste. Damage to both nerves leads to widespread oral sensory loss. At present, the link between sensory alterations and weight gain has not been established for adults (e.g., does increased fat preference occur in individuals with oral sensory intensifications, those with losses, or both?). Finally, pain in non-oral locations is also related to taste loss. When participants rated “the most intense pain of any kind they had ever experienced,” those with the greatest taste loss gave the highest ratings. These effects suggest that taste loss significantly influences long-term health outcomes.},

Under the guidance of a distinguished team of international experts, 6 volumes collected 300 articles from all the top scientists laying out our current knowledge on the anatomy, physiology, and molecular biology of sensory organs. Topics covered include the perception, psychophysics, and higher order processing of sensory information, as well as disorders and new diagnostic and treatment methods. Written for a wide audience, this reference work provides students, scholars, medical doctors, and anyone interested in neuroscience a comprehensive overview of the knowledge accumulated on the function of sense organs, sensory systems, and how the brain processes sensory input. Leading scholars from around the world contributed articles, making The Senses a truly international portrait of sensory physiology. The set is the definitive reference on sensory neuroscience on the market, and will provide the ultimate entry point into the review and original literature in Sensory Neuroscience, and be a natural place for interested students and scientists to deepen their knowledge."--},

This dictionary is a treasure trove covering 2000 years of Ancient Greek: from Mycenaean via Homer and the classical period to lexicographers, such as Hesychius (5th century A.D.). It at last brings together all new data, resulting in scores of thoroughly revised etymologies.

  abstract = {The Oxford Handbook of World History               presents thirty-one articles by leading historians on the most important issues explored by contemporary world historians. These broadly fall into four categories: conceptions of the global past, themes in world history, processes of world history, and regions in world history. The articles on conceptions deal with issues of space and time as treated in the field of world history as well as questions of method, epistemology, the historiography of the area, and globalization as viewed from historical perspective. Themes present in the book include the natural environment, agriculture, pastoral nomadism, science, technology, state formation, gender, and religion. Articles dealing with large-scale processes review current thinking on some of the most influential developments of the global past, including mass migrations, cross-cultural trade, biological diffusions, imperial expansion, industrialization, and cultural and religious exchanges. And finally, a set of articles explores the distinctive historical development within the world's major regions, while also situating individual regions in the larger global context.},

  abstract = {Combining strikingly new scholarship by art historians, historians, and ethnomusicologists, this interdisciplinary volume illuminates trade ties within East Asia, and from East Asia outwards, in the years 1550 to 1800. While not encyclopedic, the selected topics greatly advance our sense of this trade picture. Throughout the book, multi-part trade structures are excavated; the presence of European powers within the Asian trade nexus features as part of this narrative. Visual goods are highlighted, including lacquerwares, musical instruments, Chinese bronze coins, unfired ceramic portrait figurines, and Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Southeast Asian ceramic vessels. These essays underscore the significance of Asian industries producing multiples, and the rhetorical charge of these goods, shifting in meaning as they move. Building reverberations between merchant networks and the look of the objects themselves, this richly-illustrated book brings to light the Asian trade engine powering the early modern visual cultures of East and Southeast Asia, the American colonies, and Europe.},

In Eating the Empire, Troy Bickham unfolds the extraordinary role that food played in shaping Britain during the `long' eighteenth century (c. 1660-1837), when coffee, tea, and sugar went from rare luxuries to some of the most ubiquitous commodities in Britain, reaching even the poorest and remotest of households. Bickham reveals how the trade in the empire's edibles underpinned the emerging consumer economy, fomenting the rise of modern retailing, visual advertising and consumer credit, and, via taxes, financed the military and civil bureaucracy that secured, governed and spread the empire.},

  abstract = {Aluminum potassium sulphate [AIK(SO4)2 12H2O—‘alum’] was tested for its ability to elicit oral astringency independently of its ability to elicit taste. First, the astringency produced by alum (10 g/l; 21.1 mM) on the non-gustatory surfaces between the gum and the upper lip was measured. Subjects reported that alum elicited sensations of astringency when the upper lip was moved laterally against the gum. Second, subjects dipped the tongue into two solutions—alum or a mixture solution that approximated the taste of alum—and attempted to determine which solution was more astringent. A slight tendency was found for subjects to identify the mixture as more astringent than the alum. However, the same subjects reported the alum to be more astringent than the mixture when the same solutions were applied under the upper lip. These two experiments support the hypothesis that tactile stimulation is important for producing astringency, whereas taste stimulation of the anterior tongue is not. Third, after the application of alum, lubricating rinses (water, sucrose, Salivart®, corn oil, and the subjects' own saliva) were compared for their ability to decrease astringency. The lubricants reliably decreased original astringency, but to varying degrees depending upon their lubricating properties. All three experiments suggest that tactile sensations caused by increased friction (decreases,in salivary lubrication) between oral membranes are the primary basis of astringent sensations.},

Asia and the Pacific are the particular regions that the conference focuses on as they have become new centers of knowledge production in arts and humanities and, in the future, seem to be able to grow significantly as a major contributor of culture, science and arts to the globalized world. The book will help shed light on what arts and humanities scholars in Asia and the Pacific have done in terms of research and knowledge development, as well as the new frontiers of research that have been explored and opening up, which can connect the two regions with the rest of the globe."--Provided by publisher},

We provide accounts of the medicines and foods, with comparisons to other works of the time and to modern folk uses of these medicines in the Middle East.

  abstract = {We discuss the development of a multilingual lexicon linked to the SUMO formal ontology. The ontology as well as the lexicon have been expressed in OWL, as well as their original formats, for use on the semantic web and in linked data. We describe the Open Multilingual Wordnet, a multilingual wordnet with twenty two languages and a rich structure of semantic relations. It is made by exploiting links from various monolingual wordnets to the English Wordnet. Currently, it contains 118,337 concepts expressed in 1,643,260 senses in 22 languages. It is available as simple tab separated files, wordnet-LMF or lemon and had been used by many projects including Babelnet and Google translate. We then discuss some issues in extending the wordnets and improving the multi-lingual representation to cover concepts not lexicalized in English and how concepts are stated in the formal ontology.},

  abstract = {For millennia, spices have been an integral part of human diets and commerce. Recently, the widespread recognition of diethealth linkages bolsters their dietary importance. The bioactive components present in them are of considerable significance owing to their therapeutic potential against various ailments. They provide physiological benefits or prevent chronic ailment in addition to the fundamental nutrition and often included in the category of functional foods. Black pepper (Piper Nigrum L.) is an important healthy food owing to its antioxidant, antimicrobial potential and gastro-protective modules. Black pepper, with piperine as an active ingredient, holds rich phytochemistry that also includes volatile oil, oleoresins, and alkaloids. More recently, cell-culture studies and animal modeling predicted the role of black pepper against number of maladies. The free-radical scavenging activity of black pepper and its active ingredients might be helpful in chemoprevention and controlling progression of tumor growth. Additionally, the key alkaloid components of Piper Nigrum, that is, piperine assist in cognitive brain functioning, boost nutrient’s absorption and improve gastrointestinal functionality. In this comprehensive treatise, efforts are made to elucidate the antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, gastro-protective, and antidepressant activities of black pepper. Moreover, the synergistic interaction of black pepper with different drugs and nutrients is the limelight of the manuscript. However, the aforementioned health-promoting benefits associated with black pepper are proven in animal modeling. Thus, there is a need to conduct controlled randomized trials in human subjects, cohort studies, and meta-analyses. Such future studies would be helpful in recommending its application in diet-based regimens to prevent various ailments.},

We examined calcium responses of rat taste receptor cells in situ to a panel of bitter compounds to determine whether individual cells distinguish between bitter stimuli. Most bitter-responsive taste cells were activated by only one out of five compounds tested. In taste cells that responded to multiple stimuli, there were no significant associations between any two stimuli. Bitter sensation does not appear to occur through the activation of a homogeneous population of broadly tuned bitter-sensitive taste cells. Instead, different bitter stimuli may activate different subpopulations of bitter-sensitive taste cells.},

  abstract = {"This volume explores the shift in eating research from the search for bodily signals that trigger hunger to a focus on eating patterns emerging from a learning process that is based on life experience. This new book offers hope that healthful eating patterns can be learned. The volume proposes models for normal eating behavior and discusses how and why eating deviates from these norms." "Leading investigators in the field present their findings on four factors that influence how our eating patterns develop: physiological factors, including those factors leading to taste aversions developmental factors, starting with the effects of a pregnant woman's food choices on her child's later food preferences biological factors, including genetics and the search for internal cues that prompt eating factors cultural factors, including the powerful influence of family and social norms." "Why We Eat What We Eat explores how these factors interact to shape our individual eating preferences and discusses the implications of this research for practitioners. The volume also compares eating patterns in the nonobese and the obese person and discusses the short-term satiety factor that ensures consumption of a variety of foods." "Why We Eat What We Eat expands on themes in the well-received volume Taste, Experience, and Feeding and makes the information accessible to a wider audience. It will be of value to anyone interested in eating and its psychological aspects: health psychology researchers and practitioners, physicians, pediatricians, nutritionalists, educators, students, and parents."–BOOK JACKET.},

  abstract = {Summary Since Japanese language makes extensive use of Chinese characters in its writing system, and a large portion of its vocabulary is borrowed from Chinese in ancient times, it makes people to believe that Chinese always has the overwhelming influence on Japanese. However, the situation is completely changed since modern times. A great number of Japanese words entered into Chinese. Nevertheless, many Chinese people still think that nowadays Chinese language is in a dominant position in linguistic exchange between Chinese and Japanese. The goal of this research is to give people better understanding of the significance of Japanese loanwords in modern Chinese. In this paper, I analyze the channels, classifications, characteristics and influences of Japanese loanwords in different time backgrounds. The findings are mainly based on about one thousand Japanese loanwords that I collected from dictionaries and academic papers. The main results are that Japanese loanwords take an important part in creating new words and formating modern Chinese. Research also indicates that both linguistic factor and social factor affect loanwords, meanwhile, the host language and society are influenced by loanwords. Therefore both Chinese language and society affect the intakes of Japanese loanwords, at the same time the Chinese language and society are also influenced by Japanese loanwords.},

  abstract = {Using newly developed concepts of network theory, this paper tries to advance the theoretical analysis of Zheng He’s seven epic voyages across the Indian Ocean between 1405 and 1433, and to resolve some long-debated key issues on the subject. It also attempts to reveal how Zheng He helped change Sino-foreign relations in the early fifteenth ­century by developing tribute-trade networks overseas, and thereby i­ nfluenced the history of China, the Indian Ocean region, and globalization in general. An e­ xamination of the primary sources from the network perspective indicates that the development of tribute-trade relations overseas made up the primary purpose, major ­activities and enduring historical legacies of Zheng He’s voyages. Zheng He initiated the construction of overseas bases for navigation and trade, and thus greatly promoted the institutionalization and expansion of tribute-trade relations between China and the Indian Ocean world. Both the tribute and trade networks contracted ­after Zheng He’s voyages ended because of their failure to diversify beyond state-m­ onopolized diplomacy and trade. But their development in the early fifteenth century and their continuity thereafter brought China and Indian Ocean countries into unprecedented interactions. The dual networks also provided a foundation for the European “geographic discoveries” in the Indian Ocean later on, for the early contact between China and the West and ultimately for the globalization of the modern world. ­Therefore, a network analysis of Zheng He’s voyages and the subsequent tribute-trade relations between China and the Indian Ocean world can refine the current theoretical paradigms and narrative frameworks of world history, which are still centered on the rise and expansion of modern Europe and the West. It also reveals how such non-Western historical movements and premodern tribute-trade relations exerted influence on a global network revolution, which linked the old and new worlds through an unprecedented level of relational institutionalization, expansion, diversification and interactions between varied network members in global history.},

We are as delighted to see the topic revisited after sixteen years as the editor, who states that Wang's article is ‘a valued addition to our series on English, China, China English, and Chinglish, and to Malischewski's original piece’ (McArthur 2004:2). However, we found that quite a number of words listed in the article are not loanwords, because of misunderstandings regarding               loan word               and               loan translation               in English and               wailaici               and               wailaiyu               , equivalents of               loanword               in a broader sense in Chinese, as a result of which his classification of the borrowings is confusing. The article has also tended to over-simplify the complex situation of such borrowings in Chinese and as such is misleading. We would like in this paper to clarify some of the misunderstandings and offer a brief introduction to the study of English borrowings in Chinese, a field which began c.1913 with the publication of Evan Morgan's               Chinese New Terms \& Expressions               in Shanghai.},

For example, if we provide a large reward to indicate that something about the world is satisfactory to us, it may hypothesize that what satisfied us was the sending of the reward itself; no observation can refute that. Then we argue that this ambiguity will lead it to intervene in whatever protocol we set up to provide data for the agent about its goal. We discuss an analogous failure mode of approximate solutions to assistance games. Finally, we briefly review some recent approaches that may avoid this problem.},

  abstract = {The question of how best to classify Modern Standard Chinese loanwords is rather a fraught one. Various principles of categorization have been proposed in the literature; however, previous classification systems have generally covered only a relatively small proportion of all loanwords currently in use. Even attempts to provide an exhaustive catalog of lexical borrowing strategies have often been characterized by nontransparent structure, internal inconsistency or even incompleteness. This has hindered meaningful cross-linguistic comparisons of language change in Modern Standard Chinese vis-à-vis other languages. The aim of this paper is to present a new and clearly structured, comprehensive inventory of the different types of lexical borrowing that have occurred in Modern Standard Chinese over the past 30 to 40 years. Systematic cross-linguistic comparisons reveal that examples of almost all of the categories of lexical borrowing noted in the literature on English language change can likewise be provided in relation to Modern Standard Chinese. In addition, Chinese offers several options for borrowing lexical items not available to speakers of English. Overall, this paper presents a picture of Modern Standard Chinese speakers as cultivating a flexible, creative, playful approach to their use of language. The explicit recognition of the fact that many so-called “alphabetic words” are established loanwords is found to have implications for the typological classification of Chinese script, as well as for other fields such as second language teaching. A secondary finding not anticipated in the research question is that Chinese orthography shows tentative early signs of potentially developing from a morpho-logographic to a phonetic writing system.},

A Portuguese physician of Jewish ancestry, Orta lived in Goa for almost thirty years. The port city was an important but remote territory in the Portuguese empire, occupying a prominent role in the circuit of trade and exchange of goods such as botanical simples, drugs and spices. Orta's Colloquies presents fifty-nine dialogues concerning more than eighty different drugs, fruits, spices, minerals and medical preparations, all of them either native to India or observed in use there during the author's time in the territory. The book had a market in Asia but was particularly valuable to a European audience, circulating widely in Portugal and Spain, as well as providing the basis for adaptations, commentaries and editions in various languages"--},

  abstract = {Although embalming is traditionally considered an Egyptian custom, ancient sources suggest that in imperial Rome the practice was not employed by Egyptians or Egyptianized Romans alone. The mos Romanorum in funerary ritual encompassed both cremation and inhumation, yet embalming appears in Rome as early as the first century AD and evidence points to its limited use during the first three centuries AD. Within the social structure of Rome's dead these preserved corpses certainly occupied a distinct place. Yet who were they and why were they embalmed? It is argued here that various factors allowed for the occasional use of embalming by Romans: (1) an apparent shift in attitudes towards Egypt, (2) the manipulation of death ritual for social distinction, and (3) the flexibility of the traditional Roman funeral, which was able to incorporate deviations in methods of body disposal. Although embalming has been largely ignored as a significant aspect of Roman funerary history, its patrons come from the classes of highest status, including even the imperial household. This fact alone makes it worthwhile to examine this small corpus of evidence. For example, the emperor Nero embalmed his wife Poppaea; such a deviation from standard disposal methods reflects imperial fashion, but also requires us to re-evaluate Nero's reign and, especially, the societal constructs of Neronian Rome. This study attempts to contextualize embalming within Roman society and offer some likely causes and effects of its use.},

  abstract = {Talking about odors and flavors is difficult for most people, yet experts appear to be able to convey critical information about wines in their reviews. This seems to be a contradiction, and wine expert descriptions are frequently received with criticism. Here, we propose a method for probing the language of wine reviews, and thus offer a means to enhance current vocabularies, and as a by-product question the general assumption that wine reviews are gibberish. By means of two different quantitative analyses—support vector machines for classification and Termhood analysis—on a corpus of online wine reviews, we tested whether wine reviews are written in a consistent manner, and thus may be considered informative; and whether reviews feature domain-specific language. First, a classification paradigm was trained on wine reviews from one set of authors for which the color, grape variety, and origin of a wine were known, and subsequently tested on data from a new author. This analysis revealed that, regardless of individual differences in vocabulary preferences, color and grape variety were predicted with high accuracy. Second, using Termhood as a measure of how words are used in wine reviews in a domain-specific manner compared to other genres in English, a list of 146 wine-specific terms was uncovered. These words were compared to existing lists of wine vocabulary that are currently used to train experts. Some overlap was observed, but there were also gaps revealed in the extant lists, suggesting these lists could be improved by our automatic analysis.},

  abstract = {Significance             The prehistoric settlement of Madagascar by people from distant Southeast Asia has long captured both scholarly and public imagination, but on the ground evidence for this colonization has eluded archaeologists for decades. Our study provides the first, to our knowledge, archaeological evidence for an early Southeast Asian presence in Madagascar and reveals that this settlement extended to the Comoros. Our findings point to a complex Malagasy settlement history and open new research avenues for linguists, geneticists, and archaeologists to further study the timing and process of this population movement. They also provide insight into early processes of Indian Ocean biological exchange and in particular, Madagascar’s floral introductions, which account for one-tenth of its current vascular plant species diversity.           ,              The Austronesian settlement of the remote island of Madagascar remains one of the great puzzles of Indo-Pacific prehistory. Although linguistic, ethnographic, and genetic evidence points clearly to a colonization of Madagascar by Austronesian language-speaking people from Island Southeast Asia, decades of archaeological research have failed to locate evidence for a Southeast Asian signature in the island’s early material record. Here, we present new archaeobotanical data that show that Southeast Asian settlers brought Asian crops with them when they settled in Africa. These crops provide the first, to our knowledge, reliable archaeological window into the Southeast Asian colonization of Madagascar. They additionally suggest that initial Southeast Asian settlement in Africa was not limited to Madagascar, but also extended to the Comoros. Archaeobotanical data may support a model of indirect Austronesian colonization of Madagascar from the Comoros and/or elsewhere in eastern Africa.},

  abstract = {Background: Previous lists number from 55 to 176 plant species as “Biblical Medicinal Plants.” Modern studies attest that many names on these lists are no longer valid. This situation arose due to old mistranslations and/or mistakes in botanical identification. Many previously recognized Biblical plants are in no way related to the flora of the Bible lands. Accordingly, the list needs revision. Methods: We re-examine the list of possible medicinal plants in the Bible based on new studies in Hebrew Biblical philology and etymology, new studies on the Egyptian and Mesopotamian medicinal use of plants, on ethnobotany and on archaeobotany. Results: In our survey, we suggest reducing this list to 45 plant species. Our contribution comprises 20 “newly” suggested Biblical Medicinal Plants. Only five species are mentioned directly as medicinal plants in the Bible: Fig (Ficus carica), Nard (Nardostachys jatamansi), Hyssop (Origanum syriacum), balm of Gilead (Commiphora gileadensis) and Mandrake (Mandragora officinarum). No fewer than 18 medicinal plants are mentioned in old Jewish postBiblical sources, in addition to those in the Bible. Most of these plants (15) are known also in Egypt and Mesopotamia while three are from Egypt only. Seven of our suggested species are not mentioned in the Bible or in the Jewish postBiblical literature but were recorded as medicinal plants from Egypt, as well as from Mesopotamia. It is quite logical to assume that they can be included as Biblical Medicinal Plants. Conclusions: All our suggested Biblical Medicinal Plants are known as such in Ancient Egypt and/or Mesopotamia also. Examination of our list shows that all these plants have been in continuous medicinal use in the Middle East down the generations, as well as being used in the Holy Land today. Precisely in King Solomon’s words, “That which has been is what will be, that which is done is what will be done. And there is nothing new under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 1:9).},

  abstract = {The origin of the words ‘cacao’ and ‘chocolate’ and their use in the reconstruction of the early history of Mesoamerica, remain very controversial issues. Cambell and Kaufman (1976, American Antiquity 41:80–89), for example, proposed that the word ‘cacao’ originated from Mixe–Zoque languages, thus possibly representing Olmec traditions. According to this argument, other Mesoamerican languages, including Nahuatl, borrowed the word as a symbol of prestige and Olmec influence. Other researchers claim the word ‘chocolate’ represents a more recent neologism, a possible Maya–Nahuatl hybrid, due to the late appearance of the word in central Mexico’s Colonial sources. We refute the putative Mixe–Zoque origin of ‘cacao’ and provide linguistic evidence to propose that ‘cacao,’ like ‘chocolate,’ is a Uto-Aztecan term. Analysis of these words highlights general and particular evolutionary trends that originate from the Uto-Aztecan language family. In addition, we show that these two words were initially used as descriptive terms to refer to the shape of the plant’s bean and the techniques of drink preparation. Etymological evidence verifies the use of a Mayan term for cacao as early as the Classic period (fourth century a.d.). This early appearance of the term in Mayan and the later diffusion of the Nahua word throughout all of Mesoamerica correlate with additional data to support the conclusion that Teotihuacanos spoke Nahuatl.},

The authors draw on a mass of fascinating sources beyond the familiar recipes of the Roman gourmet Apicius, who mainly described the food of the privileged classes at the end of the Roman Empire. All types of food are represented here, allowing the modern cook to re-create the varied diet of the classical world, from the banquets of the rich to the simpler meals of soldiers, farmers, and slaves. We can still enjoy Terrine of Asparagus, Sweet Wine Cakes, Olive Relish, or Toronaean Shark. Each chapter provides a historical outline, with translations of the original recipes followed by versions for the modern cook. The book is illustrated throughout with delightful scenes of food, hunters, and revelers from wall paintings, mosaics, and Greek vases.},

  abstract = {"Of the approximately 5,000 languages spoken around the globe today, Andrew Dalby predicts that half will be lost during this century. How will this linguistic extinction affect our lives? Is there a possibility that humanity will become a monolingual species? Should we care?" "Language in Danger is an historical investigation into the disappearance of languages and the consequences that future generations may face. Whether describing the effects of Latin's displacement of native languages in the aftermath of Rome's imperial expansion or the aggressive extermination of hundreds of indigenous North American languages through a brutal policy of forcing Native Americans to learn English, Dalby reveals that linguistic extinction has traditionally occurred as a result of economic inequality, political oppression, and even genocide. Bringing this historical perspective to bear on the uncertain fate of hundreds of pocket cultures - cultures whose languages are endangered by less obvious threats, such as multinational economic forces, immigration, nationalism, and global telecommunications - Language in Danger speaks out against the progressive silencing of our world's irreplaceable voices." "More than an account of the decline of linguistic diversity, Language in Danger explains why humanity must protect its many unique tongues. Since all languages represent different ways of perceiving, mapping, and classifying the world, they act as repositories for cultural traditions and localized knowledge. The growing trend toward linguistic standarization - for example, politically designated national languages - threatens the existence of more marginalized cultures and ethnic customs, leaving only a few dominant tongues. The resulting languages become less flexible, nuanced, and inventive as they grow increasingly homogenized. Dalby argues that humanity needs linguistic variety not only to communicate, but to sustain and enhance our understanding of the world."–BOOK JACKET.},

However, whereas the Western historiography usually discusses Indian cotton and Chinese silk in connection with European imports, or with their sales in the Indian Ocean and the Middle East, cotton and silk were also exchanged between India and China. Indeed, Indian cotton and Chinese silk were probably the principal manufactured goods exchanged between these civilizations. Although Indian records are fragmentary, especially when compared with the voluminous Chinese sources, Indian cotton goods are known to have reached the Indianized states in Xinjiang in the early Common Era (CE), and may have been produced there, in Khotan and the neighbouring states, by the time that indigenous silk production was known to exist in India in the fourth and fifth centuries CE. Yet, while in later centuries large amounts of cotton cloth were produced in China while indigenous centres of silk production developed in India, exchanges of the finest types of cotton and silk cloth continued, usually driven by cultural and social factors in each civilization.]},

  abstract = {In August 1756 the East India Company defeated the young Mughal emperor and forced him to establish in his richest provinces a new administration run by English merchants who collected taxes through means of a ruthless private army--what we would now call an act of involuntary privatization. The East India Company's founding charter authorized it to "wage war" and it had always used violence to gain its ends. But the creation of this new government marked the moment that the East India Company ceased to be a conventional international trading corporation dealing in silks and spices and became something much more unusual: an aggressive colonial power in the guise of a multinational business. In less than four decades it had trained up a security force of around 200,000 men--twice the size of the British army--and had subdued an entire subcontinent, conquering first Bengal and finally, in 1803, the Mughal capital of Delhi itself. The Company's reach stretched until almost all of India south of the Himalayas was effectively ruled from a boardroom in London. The Anarchy tells the remarkable story of how one of the world's most magnificent empires disintegrated and came to be replaced by a dangerously unregulated private company, based thousands of miles overseas in on small office, five windows wide, and answerable only to its distant shareholders. In his most ambitious and riveting book to date, William Dalrymple tells the story of the East India Company as it has never been told before, unfolding a timely cautionary tale of the first global corporate power. -- Dust jacket flap},

Their account of where and how cinnamon was obtained proves that exaggerated marketing techniques were not invented in the past. In spite of its widespread use, the origins of cinnamon was the Arab merchants’ best-kept secret until the early 10th century. To maintain their monopoly on cinnamon trade and justify its exorbitant price, Arab traders' interlaced colorful stories for their buyers about where and how they obtained the luxurious spice. Therefore, they furnished details on the origin of cinnamon which were not true. Many scholars believe that cinnamon was brought from Sri Lanka during that period and it needs to be investigated.},

  abstract = {The unique relationship between word and image in ancient Egypt is a defining feature of that ancient culture's records. All hieroglyphic texts are composed of images, and large-scale figural imagery in temples and tombs is often accompanied by texts. Epigraphy and palaeography are two distinct, but closely related, ways of recording, analyzing, and interpreting texts and images. This Handbook stresses technical issues about recording text and art and interpretive questions about what we do with those records and why we do it. It offers readers three key things: a diachronic perspective, covering all ancient Egyptian scripts from prehistoric Egypt through the Coptic era (fourth millennium BCE-first half of first millennium CE), a look at recording techniques0that considers the past, present, and future, and a focus on the experiences of colleagues. The diachronic perspective illustrates the range of techniques used to record different phases of writing in different media. The consideration of past, present, and future techniques allows readers to understand and assess why epigraphy and palaeography is or was done in a particular manner by linking the aims of a particular effort with the technique chosen to reach those aims. The choice of techniques is a matter of goals and the records' work circumstances, an inevitable consequence of epigraphy being a double projection: geometrical, transcribing in two dimensions an object that exists physically in three; and mental, an interpretation, with an inevitable selection among the object's defining characteristics. The experiences of colleagues provide a range of perspectives and opinions about issues such as techniques of recording, challenges faced in the field, and ways of reading and interpreting text and image. These accounts are interesting and instructive stories of innovation in the face of scientific conundrum},

Here, Erwann de Kerros, a professional spice hunter, and food writer Bénédicte Bortoli introduce the vast varieties of pepper, showing how the origins and quality of the pepper we use directly affect the enjoyment of our food. Featuring more than 50 flavorful varieties, including white and black Penja peppercorns, the Tellicherry, the Batak berry, and more, the book depicts the unique colors and shapes of different berries and peppercorns in beautiful detail, alongside flavor profiles, suggestions for uses, and botanical analysis. Stunning photographs depict de Kerros's adventures sourcing pepper from Nepal, Cameroon, Indonesia, and Ethiopia, and acclaimed French chefs Didier Edon and Olivier Arlot contribute more than 40 recipes, all employing pepper. With more than 200 photographs and botanical drawings, this is the definitive guide to one of the most significant spices." –},

The book also compares and contrasts the texts of the Muziris papyrus with other documents pertinent to Indo-Mediterranean (or Indo-European) trade in ancient, medieval, and early modern times. These other documents reveal the commercial and political geography of ancient South India; the sailing schedule and the size of the ships plying the South India sea route; the commodities exchanged in the South Indian emporia; and the taxes imposed on the Indian commodities en route from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. When viewed against the twin backdrops of ancient sources on South Indian trade and of medieval and early modern documents on pepper commerce, the two texts become foundational resources for the history of commercial relationships between South India and the West"--},

Beginning with Christopher Columbus's first observations of New World flora, the Spanish crown sought out spices to cultivate for economic gain. Although they were ultimately unsuccessful in efforts to generate a large-scale spice trade, colonial officials and local entrepreneurs participated in a coordinated program of empirical information gathering and botanical experimentation that is itself of historical significance. For the empirical and experimental–"scientific"–methods they represented serve to challenge and enhance current understanding of several historiographical themes: the origins of economic botany and the Scientific Revolution more generally, the role of human agency in the Columbian exchange, and the dissemination of knowledge from imperial centers to colonial peripheries.]},

I raise concerns with both interpretative tendencies, which have often yielded superficial regional histories that provide one-dimensional impressions of people, practices and places in the past. Drawing on my own archaeological research into early agriculture and arboriculture, I illustrate alternative possibilities for historical interpretation that do not over-emphasize the pre-Lapita isolation of New Guinea, but instead focus on regional interactions and mutual transformations of practice before, during and after the presumed arrival of Austronesian language-speakers in the region.},

Other textual and explanatory information is included, such as typical circumstances in which a world may be used, thus giving fresh insights into aspects of Greek language and culture.

  abstract = {The Greek physician Dioscorides lived in the first century AD during the reign of the Emperor Nero. Dioscorides's five-volume treatise Perì üles iatrichès, commonly known in Latin as De materia medica (Of medical substances), is considered the most important medical manual and pharmacopeia of ancient Greece and Rome. It was highly regarded in the Middle Ages in both the Western and Arab worlds. It covers the therapeutic effectiveness of natural substances of animal, vegetable, and mineral origin. The manuscript presented here preserves fragments of an Arabic translation of Dioscorides's work. The work is known in Arabic under various titles, including Kitāb al-ḥashāʼish (The book of plants), Kitāb al-maqālāt al-khams (The five-essay book), or simply, as in this manuscript, Kitāb Disqūrīdis (Dioscorides's book). The first Arabic translation of Dioscorides's work was made by Istafan ibn Basil (Stephanos Basilos) and enhanced by his famed mentor Hunayn ibn Ishaq al-ʻIbadi (circa 809--73), who was tasked by Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun to head the historic Bayt al-Hikmah (The House of Wisdom) in Baghdad. This manuscript was most likely copied in Upper Mesopotamia in the 12th century. The work is written in a beautiful naskhi script on parchment. It contains entries from all five books, beginning with plant-based ointments (Book I), and ending with wines and mineral-based potions (Book V). Folio 19 verso gives the name of Hisham ibn Musa ibn Yusuf as the scribe or, possibly, the translator. His title is given as al-masīḥī al-mutaṭabbib, suggesting he was a Christian herbalist. The manuscript is held in the National Library of France, together with two other, similar Arabic manuscripts on Dioscorides. The version preserved here differs from both. A printed text in French at the beginning, which dates from 1909, is a commentary on the colorful illustrations of plants and creatures in the manuscript. It is followed by handwritten notes comparing the differences in Arabic text in each translation, and enumerating the entries of plants and substances included in Dioscorides's work.

It outlines the grammar of Proto-Indo-European, considers the changes by which one dialect of that prehistoric language developed into Proto-Germanic, and provides a detailed account of the grammar of Proto-Germanic. In the course of his exposition Don Ringe draws on a long tradition of work on many languages, including Hittite, Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Slavic, Gothic, and Old Norse. This second edition has been significantly revised to provide a more in-depth account of Proto-Indo-European, with further exploration of disputed points; it has also been updated to include new developments in the field, particularly in the reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European verb and nominal inflection. The author also reconsiders some of his original approaches to specific linguistic changes and their relative chronology based on his recent research.},

  abstract = {Why are fog, dew, and frost said to ?fall? in some languages when they don?t in the physical world? We explore this seeming infelicity to study the nature of linguistic conceptualization. We focus on variations and changes of the morphosemantic behaviors of weather words in Mandarin and other Sinitic languages with an interdisciplinary approach to establish links between linguistic expressions and scientific facts. We propose that this use of directionality is the result of conventionalization of Chinese people?s inference from shared daily experience, and is well motivated in terms of a linguistic ontology that reflects a scientific account of natural phenomena. We further demonstrate that the semantically relevant orthography shared by Chinese speakers can be directly mapped to Hantology, a formal linguistic ontology based on Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO). In this mapping, the radical ? y? ?rain,? derived from the ideograph of ?rain? to represent atmospheric water, provides crucial clues to the use of directional verbs and the parts of speech of weather words. Our findings also lend support to language-based reconstruction of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and lay foundation for TEK research in the Sinosphere.},

This series of interconnected essays and lectures surveys the most critically important and hotly contested issues in Hinduism over 3,500 years, from the ancient time of the Vedas to the present day. The essays contemplate the nature of Hinduism; Hindu concepts of divinity; attitudes concerning gender, control, and desire; the question of reality and illusion; and the impermanent and the eternal in the two great Sanskrit epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Among the questions Doniger considers are: Are Hindus monotheists or polytheists? How can atheists be Hindu, and how can unrepentant Hindu sinners find salvation? Why have Hindus devoted so much attention to the psychology of addiction? What does the significance of dogs and cows tell us about Hinduism? How have Hindu concepts of death, rebirth, and karma changed over the course of history? How and why does a pluralistic faith, remarkable for its intellectual tolerance, foster religious intolerance? Doniger concludes with four concise autobiographical essays in which she reflects on her lifetime of scholarship, Hindu criticism of her work, and the influence of Hinduism on her own philosophy of life. On Hinduism is the culmination of over forty years of scholarship from a renowned expert on one of the world's great faiths"--},

Hinduism does not lend itself easily to a strictly chronological account. Many of its central texts cannot be reliably dated within a century; its central tenets arise at particular moments in Indian history and often differ according to gender or caste; and the differences between groups of Hindus far outnumber the commonalities. Yet the greatness of Hinduism lies precisely in many of these idiosyncratic qualities that continues to inspire debate today. This groundbreaking work elucidates the relationship between recorded history and imaginary worlds, the inner life and the social history of Hindus.},

As the distinction between foreign and indigenous faded, the influence and popularity of the chili grew, redefining the term "spicy" and appearing in a wide variety of literary texts and art. The cultural symbolism surrounding the chili has even tied the pepper to Mao Zedong as revolutionary imagery, and it continues to be used in Chinese pop culture as a symbol of regional and national identity"},

In this respect, the vocabulary of medical texts represents an important field of enquiry. Most terms come from Middle Indian, but a significant number are of Middle Iranian origin. This component, mostly ingredients and technical vocabulary, seems to be largely of Khotanese origin.

  abstract = {Objective To determine if individuals who taste 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP), one marker of genetic variation in taste, as exceptionally bitter can also perceive sugars as sweeter, other bitters as more intense, and dietary fats as more creamy and/or viscous than do individuals who taste PROP as weakly bitter. This study examined the association between genetic variation in taste and acceptance for sweet, high-fat, and bitter foods and beverages. Design Genetic variation was measured by perceived bitterness of PROP. (influenced by genetic, hormonal, and pathologic factors) and density of fungi form papillae on the anterior portion of the tongue (influenced primarily by genetic factors). Four sweet, 3 fat, and 3 bitter groups were derived from principal components analyses of questionnaire items. Subjects Convenience sample of healthy adults (24 women, 22 men; mean age±standard deviation=21±6 years) who did not report high dietary restraint. Statistical analyses Pearson product moment correlations between genetic taste measures and food and beverage groups. Results The sample showed diversity in genetic taste measures: perceived bitterness of 0.0032mol/L PROP ranged from “weak” to well above “very strong”; fungi form papillae densities ranged from 33 to 156 papillae per square centimeter. Distribution of perceived bitterness of PROP and fungi form papillae density differed in women and men. The association between genetic taste measures and acceptance of sweet and high-fat groups differed in women and men. In women, liking of sweet and high-fat food and beverage groups decreased with increasing perceived bitterness of PROP. In men, liking of these foods and beverages increased but with increasing papillae densities. Genetic taste measures were not associated with a dislike of bitter food and beverage groups. Applications The influence of genetic variation in taste on food intake depends on how perceptible sweet, fat, or bitter components are in foods and beverages, as well as the value of sensory factors vs other factors (eg, health, convenience) on personal dietary choices. Female supertasters of PROP bitterness may avoid high-fat or sweet foods because these oral sensations are too intense and thus less pleasant. Supertasters may taste more bitterness in vegetables but still enjoy eating them because of their healthfulness and because condiments (especially those that are salt based) can block bitterness.

  abstract = {This book provides a guide to the most significant contours in the geography of the lexicographical world, as well as offering series of eye-witness accounts of the major issues confronting lexicographers and the users of dictionaries today. Part I considers the synchronic dictionary, and especially three characteristic types: (1) the dictionary for the general readership (many peoples conception of the dictionary); (2) the monolingual dictionary intended for L2 learners; and (3) the bilingual dictionary. These are placed together so that, after their distinctive features have been set out, common areas of methodology can be considered together, in particular the central role of the corpus in lexicography of this type today. Such dictionaries are normally also synchronic, and are typically intended for a mass market, and produced by commercial publishers. Part II deals with historical dictionaries, typically edited within an academic institution and published by an academic press, and typically intended for a more specialist readership. A diachronic perspective produces particular structural and presentational challenges, so that one can identify methods and procedures that distinguish diachronic lexicography from synchronic lexicography. In Part III a set of slightly shorter chapters examine some of the most important types of specialist dictionaries and their salient qualities and methodologies, focusing on what sets each area apart, but also on the perspectives it brings to the wider lexicographical world. Part IV examines some topics common to various different types of lexicography, and some of the challenges and debates that cross the boundaries of sub-fields.},

  abstract = {"Historians have traced the traditions of Islamic scholarship back to late antiquity. Muslim scholars were at work as early as 750 CE/AD, painstakingly copying their commentaries and legal opinions onto scrolls and codices. This venerable tradition embraced the modern printing press relatively late-movable type was adopted in the Middle East only in the early nineteenth century. Islamic scholars, however, initially kept their distance from the new technology, and it was not until the end of the nineteenth century that the first published editions of works of classical religious scholarship began to appear in print. As the culture of print took root, both popular and scholarly understandings of the Islamic tradition shifted. Particular religious works were soon read precisely because they were available in printed, published editions. Other equally erudite works still in scroll and manuscript form, by contrast, languished in the obscurity of manuscript repositories. The people who selected, edited, and published the new print books on and about Islam exerted a huge influence on the resulting literary tradition. These unheralded editors determined, essentially, what came to be understood by the early twentieth century as the classical written "canon" of Islamic thought. Collectively, this relatively small group of editors who brought Islamic literature into print crucially shaped how Muslim intellectuals, the Muslim public, and various Islamist movements understood the Islamic intellectual tradition. In this book Ahmed El Shamsy recounts this sea change, focusing on the Islamic literary culture of Cairo, a hot spot of the infant publishing industry, from the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. As El Shamsy argues, the aforementioned editors included some of the greatest minds in the Muslim world and shared an ambitious intellectual agenda of revival, reform, and identity formation. This book tells the stories of the most consequential of these editors as well as their relations and intellectual exchanges with the European orientalists who also contributed to the new Islamic print culture"--},

  abstract = {The leaves of the Coriandrum sativum plant, known as cilantro or coriander, are widely used in many cuisines around the world. However, far from being a benign culinary herb, cilantro can be polarizing---many people love it while others claim that it tastes or smells foul, often like soap or dirt. This soapy or pungent aroma is largely attributed to several aldehydes present in cilantro. Cilantro preference is suspected to have a genetic component, yet to date nothing is known about specific mechanisms. Here we present the results of a genome-wide association study among 14,604 participants of European ancestry who reported whether cilantro tasted soapy, with replication in a distinct set of 11,851 participants who declared whether they liked cilantro. We find a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) significantly associated with soapy-taste detection that is confirmed in the cilantro preference group. This SNP, rs72921001, (p=6.4e-9, odds ratio 0.81 per A allele) lies within a cluster of olfactory receptor genes on chromosome 11. Among these olfactory receptor genes is OR6A2, which has a high binding specificity for several of the aldehydes that give cilantro its characteristic odor. We also estimate the heritability of cilantro soapy-taste detection in our cohort, showing that the heritability tagged by common SNPs is low, about 0.087. These results confirm that there is a genetic component to cilantro taste perception and suggest that cilantro dislike may stem from genetic variants in olfactory receptors. We propose that OR6A2 may be the olfactory receptor that contributes to the detection of a soapy smell from cilantro in European populations.},

All product experiences rely on information from sensory modalities. We developed a questionnaire approach to quantify the relative importance of the five sensory modalities for various descriptors of product experience. The approach was used in two studies that employed Dutch and Russian participants. The results demonstrate that the importance of a sensory modality differs for various groups of descriptors. Most symbolic descriptors demonstrated strong visual dominance. Affective descriptors were equally related to all sensory modalities. Sensory descriptors showed significant cross-cultural differences. The latter result can be explained by the different associations between literal and metaphorical meanings of sensory adjectives in different languages.},

The case study is an ancient traveling narrative, Pausanias’s Description of Greece (Periegesis Hellados) which was written in the second century CE. First, we describe the process of converting the volumes to spatial data using a customized version of the open-source digital semantic annotation platform Recogito. Then the focus shifts to the implementation of collected and organized spatial data to a number of GIS applications: namely Google Maps, DARIAH Geo-Browser, Gephi, Palladio and ArcGIS. Through empirical experimentation with spatial data and their implementation in different platforms, our paper charts the ways in which contemporary GIS applications may be implemented to cast new light on ancient understandings of identity, space, and place.},

  abstract = {Ethnopharmocological relevance During the European Middle Ages aromatic products imported from Asia and Africa were credited with both preventive and curative medical properties. In addition spices provided an image of wellness and as they were expensive and had many uses in cuisine and fragrance, they functioned as prestige consumer goods. Materials and methods This is an effort to look historically at a social and cultural phenomenon for the period roughly A.D. 1200–1500. Sources of information about the demand for and uses of spices include lists of materia medica, medical treatises, cookbooks, religious writings, descriptions of banquets and court ceremonial and literary works showing what might be called aspirational lifestyles. Results It is important to focus on the demand side of the spice trade rather than simply assuming a consistent demand and looking only at the supply (prices, routes, for example). Conclusions The demand for spices must be understood in terms of their attributed medical and wellness powers, but these in turn are related to the mysterious Eastern origins of spices that enhanced their image as elite consumer products and their association with spiritual as well as medical healing.},

"The demand for spices in medieval Europe was extravagant and was reflected in the pursuit of fashion, the formation of taste, and the growth of luxury trade. It inspired geographical and commercial exploration, as traders pursued such common spices as pepper and cinnamon and rarer aromatic products, including ambergris and musk. Ultimately, the spice quest led to imperial missions that were to change world history. This engaging book explores the demand for spices: why were they so popular, and why so expensive?

Why chile peppers? Both a spice and a vegetable, chile peppers have captivated imaginations and taste buds for thousands of years. Native to Mesoamerica and the New World, chiles are currently grown on every continent, since their relatively recent introduction to Europe (in the early 1500s via Christopher Columbus). Chiles are delicious, dynamic, and very diverse-they have been rapidly adopted, adapted, and assimilated into numerous world cuisines, and while malleable to a degree, certain heirloom varieties are deeply tied to place and culture-but now accelerating climate change may be scrambling their terroir. Over a year-long journey, three pepper-loving gastronauts-an agroecologist, a chef, and an ethnobotanist-set out to find the real stories of America's rarest heirloom chile varieties, and learn about the changing climate from farmers and other people who live by the pepper, and who, lately, have been adapting to shifting growing conditions and weather patterns. They put a face on an issue that has been made far too abstract for our own good.},

  abstract = {In §66 of Philosophical h\textasciitilde vestigations Wittgenstein looks for something common to various games and finds only an interconnecting network of resemblances. These are "family resemblances". Sympathetic as well as unsympathetic readers have interpreted him as claiming that games form a family in virtue of these resemblances. This assumes Wittgenstein inverted the relation between being a member of a family and bearing family resemblances to others of that family. (The Churchills bear family resemblances to one another because they belong to the same family, they don't belong to the same family because they resemble one another.) A close reading of Investigations gives no evidence that Wittgenstein made this mistake. Rather, family resemblances may play a role like the one criteria play for psychological terms. They give excellent but fallible evidence for membership in the extensions of some terms.},

Recent organic residue analyses performed on small early Iron Age (11th–late 10th century BCE) Phoenician clay flasks provide the first concrete archaeological evidence that such sustainable trade took place much earlier than hitherto suspected. The analysis shows that several of the flasks contained cinnamon, which in this period could only have originated in South/Southeast Asia. Here, we first summarize the rationale and results of that study. Subsequently, we provide an updated review of all sources of data relevant to the question at hand—archaeological, analytical, and textual. Finally, we offer suggestions for future research on the Asian spice trade with the West.},

As well as 40,000 headwords and 100,000 senses, the dictionary includes a vast collection of illustrative quotations taken from the canon of classical literature, each now conveniently arranged under the appropriate sense or subsense. In addition, the newly digitized text incorporates a significant amount of editorial updating, including revised English translations, expansion of many abbreviations, and clearer labelling throughout the text. The new design is a masterpiece of concision and clarity and the entire text is handsomely bound in two volumes.

It also outlines the rules to be followed when plant breeders name a new species or cultivar. The second section comprises a glossary of generic and specific plant names, and components of these, from which the reader may interpret the existing names of plants and construct new names. With explanations of the International Codes for both Botanical Nomenclature (2000) and Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (1995), this new edition contains a greatly expanded glossary, which includes the Greek, Latin, or other source of each plant name.},

Stewart Gordon has fashioned a look at Asia from A.D. 700 to 1500, a time when Asia was the world, by describing the personal journeys of Asia's many travelers–the merchants who traded spices along the Silk Road, the apothecaries who exchanged medicine and knowledge from China to the Middle East, and the philosophers and holy men who crossed continents to explore and exchange ideas, books, science, and culture.–From publisher description.},

The book has roughly 100 entries, beginning with achlorophyllous flowers that feed on the roots of a host plant, and ending with zygomorphic flowers, that pose an interesting puzzle for pollinators. In the entries in-between, readers will explore with John and William Bartram, smell the rotting corpse flower, learn about the miniature ecosystems entangled in Spanish moss, and much more. Similar to Fungipedia, the book is intended for a general audience, but thanks to Gracie's depth and breadth of knowledge, and her artful prose, it will also appeal to seasoned flower enthusiasts. The entries are accompanied by approximately 50 line drawings from Amy Jean Porter"–},

  abstract = {Persian is one of the great lingua francas of world history. Yet despite its recognition as a shared language across the Islamic world and beyond, its scope, impact, and mechanisms remain underexplored. A world historical inquiry into pre-modern cosmopolitanism, The Persianate World traces the reach and limits of Persian as a Eurasian language in a comprehensive survey of its geographical, literary, and social frontiers. From Siberia to Southeast Asia, and between London and Beijing, this book shows how Persian gained, maintained, and finally surrendered its status to imperial and vernacular competitors. Fourteen essays trace Persian’s interactions with Bengali, Chinese, Turkic, Punjabi, and other languages to identify the forces that extended “Persographia,” the domain of written Persian. Spanning the ages of expansion and contraction, The Persianate World offers a critical survey of both the supports and constraints of one of history’s key languages of global exchange. “This groundbreaking collection illuminates the multifaceted and very complex history of the rise and decline of the Persian language as a lingua franca.” AHMAD KARIMI-HAKKAK, author of Recasting Persian Poetry “With erudition and refinement, this book accomplishes something remarkable—it provides a timely corrective to an anachronistic understanding of the Persianate sphere as an empire of letters centred on Iran.” PAOLO SARTORI, author of Visions of Justice “An exceptionally important contribution to our understanding of what constituted the Persianate world.” ANDREW PEACOCK, University of St. Andrews NILE GREEN holds the Ibn Khaldun Endowed Chair in World History at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The available in vitro and animal in vivo evidence suggests that cinnamon has anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antitumor, cardiovascular, cholesterol-lowering, and immunomodulatory effects. In vitro studies have demonstrated that cinnamon may act as an insulin mimetic, to potentiate insulin activity or to stimulate cellular glucose metabolism. Furthermore, animal studies have demonstrated strong hypoglycemic properties. However, there are only very few well-controlled clinical studies, a fact that limits the conclusions that can be made about the potential health benefits of cinnamon for free-living humans. The use of cinnamon as an adjunct to the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is the most promising area, but further research is needed before definitive recommendations can be made.},

No one has posited an origin for the French term or traced any early history, except to guess that it may come from neo-Latin. Meanwhile there are forms nearly identical to the English word in the trade languages of Southern and Eastern Asia, and ancient Asian languages attest to antecedents for the word's components. The paper argues that the ancient written records and current spoken forms support a theory that turmeric is itself the word which is inaccurately echoed by pharmacological Latin and commercial French.},

Local conversions to Islam and alternative developments of networked Buddhist institutions paired with that era's economic and political opportunities in support of functional regional polities (represented in case studies of Banten, Ayutthaya, and Banjarmasin), which negated initial European East India Company ambitions to dominate regional trade.]},

The assignment of number and gender to foreign words is an area of conflict between MSA and other Arabic varieties. This paper investigates the factors that stand behind the seemingly irregularity of number and gender assignment in Arabic. It appears that speakers follow a form standardized by MSA or enforce another form following their dialects and community conventions. This variation in number and gender assignment to loans gives rise to multiple competing forms that may not be recognized by MSA or some other varieties of Arabic. Yet, the findings demonstrate consistency in assigning number and gender to loans by applying native patterns motivated by frequency of use and the semantics of the referents.},

  abstract = {"In history, myth often abides. It was long assumed that the centuries immediately prior to AD 1000 were lacking in any major cultural developments or geopolitical encounters, that the Europeans hadn't yet discovered North America, that the farthest anyone had traveled over sea was the Vikings' invasion of Britain. But how, then, to explain the presence of blonde-haired people in Mayan temple murals in Chichen Itza, Mexico? Could it be possible that the Vikings had found their way to the Americas during the height of the Mayan empire? Valerie Hansen, a much-honored historian, argues that the year 1000 was the world's first point of major cultural exchange and exploration. Drawing on nearly thirty years of research on medieval China and global history, she presents a compelling account of first encounters between disparate societies. As people on at least five continents ventured outward, they spread technology, new crops, and religion. These encounters, she shows, made it possible for Christopher Columbus to reach the Americas in 1492, and set the stage for the process of globalization that so dominates the modern era. For readers of Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel and Yuval Noah Harari's Sapiens, The Year 1000 is an intellectually daring, provocative account that will make you rethink everything you thought you knew about how the modern world came to be. It will also hold up a mirror to the hopes and fears we experience today."--},

  abstract = {Before the seventeenth century, trade across Eurasia was mostly conducted in short segments along the Silk Route and Indian Ocean. Business was organized in family firms, merchant networks, and state-owned enterprises, and dominated by Chinese, Indian, and Arabic traders. However, around 1600 the first two joint-stock corporations, the English and Dutch East India Companies, were established.{$<$}em{$>$}Going the Distance{$<$}/em{$>$} tells the story of overland and maritime trade without Europeans, of European Cape Route trade without corporations, and of how new, large-scale, and impersonal organizations arose in Europe to control long-distance trade for more than three centuries. Ron Harris shows that by 1700, the scene and methods for global trade had dramatically changed: Dutch and English merchants shepherded goods directly from China and India to northwestern Europe. To understand this transformation, Harris compares the organizational forms used in four major regions: China, India, the Middle East, and Western Europe. The English and Dutch were the last to leap into Eurasian trade, and they innovated in order to compete. They raised capital from passive investors through impersonal stock markets and their joint-stock corporations deployed more capital, ships, and agents to deliver goods from their origins to consumers. {$<$}em{$>$}Going the Distance{$<$}/em{$>$} explores the history behind a cornerstone of the modern economy, and how this organizational revolution contributed to the formation of global trade and the creation of the business corporation as a key factor in Europe's economic rise.},

  abstract = {Abstract: There is a widespread assumption that ancient “cinnamon” and “cassia” were the same as the spices now known by those names that is, products obtained from trees of the genus Cinnamomum. This article argues that this is not the case, but that the “cinnamon” and “cassia” of ancient writers very probably came from plants native to northeast Africa, as several early writers actually state. Possible African sources of ancient “cinnamon” and “cassia” are suggested. The most probable principal source is identified as Cassia abbreviata. It is also argued that alleged identifications of cinnamon or cassia at archaeological sites in the Mediterranean region are questionable. It is shown that cinnamon and cassia did not figure in Southeast Asian and Chinese trade at an early period, and that Austronesian settlement of Madagascar occurred after the Classical period, probably during the second half of the first millennium CE, too late for Southeast Asians to have played any major role in trade with the Roman Empire. There is no good reason to believe that true cinnamon and cassia were traded to the western Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean region at any very early date. This article truly takes an interdisciplinary approach to its subject: the author is a botanist as well as a historian, and is able to use original Chinese sources. The question of whether ancient “cinnamon” and “cassia” were the same as modern cinnamon and cassia (products of trees of the genus Cinnamomum) is a thorny one, which has been repeatedly debated in the past, usually with no very conclusive result. The most recent thorough discussion of the issue, by Lionel Casson, concluded that the ancient and modern products were the same. This article refutes that view: it is clear that Casson lacked the botanical knowledge necessary to reach a sound conclusion. The article deals with its subject thoroughly, examining archaeological as well as textual evidence, and using a wide range of sources.},

The construction technique of the ship appears to resemble that of the eastern Indian Ocean, not the western Indian Ocean. Various items from the wreck connect it with Southeast Asia: a piloncito coin probably came from Java. Very little from the ship suggests any link at all with the western Indian Ocean. Overall, the strongest probability is that the ship was built in Southeast Asia.},

The implications of this are discussed, and the remaining evidence of early Islamic presence in Champa is reassessed. It is suggested that there is now no good evidence of any Islamic presence there until after the sixteenth century. In relation to this issue, the maritime links between China and the Islamic world are examined, as also are other examples of possible falsification of history.},

Beginning at a period when an overland journey across the Malay Peninsula was an essential link in the routes connecting South, Southeast and East Asia, it is suggested that the first entirely maritime itinerary to be used regularly passed through the Sunda Strait.

Problems with clarifying this issue include the often poor quality of Tibetan sources, the confusion of Tibet and Tangut (Xi Xia) in Persian sources, and misunderstanding by modern scholars of Chinese terms relating to Tibet. In fact, Chinese sources make clear that there was considerable contact between the Mongols and Tibet before 1240. Chinggis Khan may never have invaded Tibet, but undoubtedly had the intention of doing so. The picture that emerges is of a gradual conquest, with early incursions across the borders of Tibet followed by more penetrating invasions in the 1240s and 1250s.},

We tested relationships between TAS2R38 genotype, taste phenotype, and fungiform papillae (FP) number in 139 females and 59 males (age range 21–60 years), primarily of European ancestry. DNA was analyzed for 3 polymorphic sites, identifying common (alanine–valine–isoleucine [AVI/AVI], heterozygotes, proline–alanine–valine [PAV/PAV]) and rare (proline–valine–isoleucine, alanine–alanine–valine, AAI) forms. Individuals with PROP threshold {$>$}0.15 mM were almost exclusively AVI/AVI; those with threshold {$<$}0.1 mM could have any genotype. PAV/PAVs were more difficult to identify with PROP taste measures, although perceived bitterness of moderate PROP concentrations (0.32, 1 mM) had better correspondence with genotype than did threshold. For AVI/AVIs, increases in bitterness from 1 to 3.2 mM PROP nearly paralleled those of TAS2R38 heterozygotes and PAV/PAVs. Some bitterness gains were related to FP number sampled from a standard area on the tongue tip, yet the PROP bitterness–FP relationship differed across genotype. Among homozygotes, FP was a significant determinant of PROP bitterness; heterozygotes showed a flat relationship. Those tasting concentrated PROP as more bitter also tasted concentrated sucrose, citric acid, sodium chloride, and quinine as more intense, even after statistically controlling for TAS2R38 genotype, FP, and intensity of tones (nonoral standard). To summarize, although PROP threshold generally exhibited single-gene complete dominance, PROP bitterness may involve additional bitter receptors as evidenced by misclassification of some nontaster homozygotes and the bitterness functions for concentrated PROP. Variability in receptor expression may explain attenuated bitterness–FP relationships. PROP bitterness does associate with heightened taste sensations (i.e., supertasting), but this is not due to TAS2R38 polymorphisms.},

  abstract = {"Eleven historians bring their knowledge and insights to bear on the long Braudelian sweep of Southeast Asian history. In doing so they seek both to debunk simplistic assumptions about fragile traditions and transformational modernities, and to identify real repeating patterns in Southeast Asia's past: clientelistic political structures, periodic tectonic and climatic disasters, ethnic occupational specializations, long cycles of economic globalization and deglobalization. Their contributions range across many centuries: from the Austronesian expansion to the Aceh tsunami, and from the Sanskrit cosmopolis to the Asian financial crisis. The book is inspired by, and dedicated to, Peter Boomgaard, a scholar whose work has embodied the Braudelian spirit in Southeast Asian historiography"--},

  abstract = {A renewed interested in Indian Ocean studies has underlined possibilities of the transnational. This study highlights lexical borrowing as an analytical tool to deepen our understanding of cultural exchanges between Indian Ocean ports during the long nineteenth century, comparing loanwords from several Asian and African languages and demonstrating how doing so can re-establish severed links between communities. In this comparative analysis, four research avenues come to the fore as specifically useful to explore the dynamics of non-elite contact in this part of the world: (1) nautical jargon, (2) textile terms, (3) culinary terms, and (4) slang associated with society’s lower strata. These domains give prominence to a spectrum of cultural brokers frequently overlooked in the wider literature. It is demonstrated through concrete examples that an analysis of lexical borrowing can add depth and substance to existing scholarship on interethnic contact in the Indian Ocean, providing methodological inspiration to examine lesser studied connections. This study reveals no unified linguistic landscape, but several key individual connections between the ports of the Indian Ocean frequented by Persian, Hindustani, and Malay-speaking communities.},

The handbook concentrates on the cultural, societal, and communicative characteristics of the Chinese language environment. Focusing on language use in action, in context, and in vivo, this book intends to lay empirical grounds for collaboration and synergy among different fields"–},

  abstract = {Avicenna, 980-1037 Author.  Abu ʻAli al-Husayn Ibn Sina was born in Bukhara (present-day Uzbekistan) in 980 and died in Hamadan (present-day Iran) in 1037. One of the intellectual luminaries of the medieval world, known in the Latin West as Avicenna, this Persian polymath was often referred to by Muslim authors as al-Shaykh al-Raʼīs (the preeminent scholar), acknowledgment of his status as one of the foremost savants of the Islamic world. A prolific author, Ibn Sina wrote on topics as varied as metaphysics, theology, medicine, psychology, earth sciences, physics, astronomy, astrology, and chemistry. Ibn Sina's fame in Europe rests principally on this work, al-Qānūn fī al-ṭibb (The canon of medicine), which was translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona in the 12th century and remained part of the standard curriculum for medical students until the late 17th century. It was due to the reputation of this work, as well as two of Ibn Sina's other works that were translated into Latin-al-Adwiya al-qalbīya (Cardiac medication) and al-Urjūza fī al-ṭibb (a versified manual on medicine)-that Ibn Sina was sometimes referred to in the Latin West as princeps medicorum (prince of physicians). The Canon of Medicine is organized into five books as follows: Book 1 is entitled al-Umūr al-kulliya fī 'ilm al-ṭibb (General medical principles) and covers the basic principles of medicine; Book 2 is entitled al-Adwiya al-mufrada (Materia medica) and lists approximately 800 individual drugs of vegetable and mineral origin; Book 3 is entitled al-Amrāḍ al-juz'iya (Special pathology) and discusses the diseases of individual organs; Book 4 is entitled al-Amrāḍ allatī lā takhtaṣṣ bi 'udw bi 'aynihi (Diseases involving more than one member) and discusses medical conditions that affect the entire body, such as fevers and poisons; Book 5 is entitled al-Adwiya al-murakkaba wa al-aqrābādhīn (Formulary) and lists some 650 medicinal compounds as well as their uses and effects. The present manuscript includes Book 1. Also present are fragments from Book 2, which appears to have sustained heavy water damage. Some of the preserved details in this part of the work include the beautiful illuminated title panel marking the beginning of the second book, which appears on page 298. There are occasional marginal additions, corrections, and glosses. The text is in black naskh script, with headings in red. The manuscript was completed in 729 AH (1329).     -  Title devised, in English, by Library staff.      -  Original resource extent: 314 folios ; 250 x 195 millimeters.      -  Reference extracted from World Digital Library: A.Z.

Some sources state that the number of books he has written is over 240; 153 of these have been discovered. Among his valuable books, the two most well-known books are al-Shifa, which deals mostly with philosophy, and the five-volume al-Qānūn Fīal-Tibb, which is a complete medical encyclopedia. The Little Qanun is the model of al-Qānūn. The idea of publishing this book struck the author's mind when he thoroughly dealt with Avicenna's views and thoughts. It is hard to imagine such discoveries were generated more than one thousand years ago"--},

Asafoetida is not only used as a culinary spice but also traditionally used to treat various diseases, including asthma, gastrointestinal disorders, intestinal parasites, etc. This oleo-gum-resin has been known to possess antifungal, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-mutagenic and antiviral activities. A wide range of chemical compounds including sugars, sesquiterpene coumarins and polysulfides have been isolated from this plant. Recent studies have shown new promising antiviral sesquiterpene coumarins from this old phytomedicine. The present review summarizes the information concerning the traditional uses, phytochemistry and biological activities of asafoetida.},

Thirteen chapters evoke the joy and discovery of reading a menu dotted with the sharp-eyed annotations of a linguist. Jurafsky points out the subtle meanings hidden in filler words like "rich" and "crispy," zeroes in on the metaphors and storytelling tropes we rely on in restaurant reviews, and charts a microuniverse of marketing language on the back of a bag of potato chips. The fascinating journey through The Language of Food uncovers a global atlas of culinary influences. With Jurafsky's insight, words like ketchup, macaron, and even salad become living fossils that contain the patterns of early global exploration that predate our modern fusion-filled world. From ancient recipes preserved in Sumerian song lyrics to colonial shipping routes that first connected East and West, Jurafsky paints a vibrant portrait of how our foods developed. A surprising history of culinary exchange - a sharing of ideas and culture as much as ingredients and flavors - lies just beneath the surface of our daily snacks, soups, and suppers.},

  abstract = {Sabur ibn Sahl (d. 255/869), a Nestorian physician and pharmacist at the Abbasid court in Baghdad, is well-known as the author of the earliest Arabic pharmaceutical handbook on record. This ‘dispensatory’ (aqraba∂in) originally circulated in three different versions (small—middle—large), but so far only the small version has been published on the basis of an old, though fragmentary, codex from Berlin. Sabur prefaced that version of his dispensatory with some highly instructive medico-pharmacological expositions in four short chapters, which are missing from the Berlin codex but retained by a younger, complementary manuscript from Tehran. Commencing with a general introduction into the subject and a brief description of the Tehran manuscript, this article provides a critical Arabic edition and an annotated English translation of these important prolegomena, which shed new light on the development of early Arabic pharmacology.},

  abstract = {The desensitization resulting from application of 10 or 100 ppm capsaicin was investigated, using daily testing of a capsaicin series (1–1000 ppm, in log steps). The series showed a significant decrement in perceived burn following desensitization with either concentration. Perceived burn of 100 and 1000 ppm did not recover from 100 ppm desensitization in six days, and perceived burn of 1–1000 ppm did not recover from 10 ppm desensitization in six days. When single capsaicin concentrations, rather than the series, were tested at one, two, four, or six days after desensitization, 10 ppm recovered from 10 ppm desensitization in one or two days, and 100 ppm recovered from 100 ppm desensitization between two and four days. This suggests that daily testing with the capsaicin series delayed recovery from desensitization. Nontasters of 6-n-propylthiouracil rated capsaicin burn lower than did tasters. The application method of rolling capsaicin onto the tongue with a swab was found to transiently inhibit brrn. Implications for ingesting capsaicin products are discussed.},

  abstract = {The word *kakaw(a) (‘cacao’, Theobroma cacao) was widely diffused among Mesoamerican languages, and from there to much of lower Central America. This study provides evidence establishing beyond reasonable doubt that this word originated in the Mije-Sokean family; that it spread from the Mije-Sokean languages in or around the Olmec heartland into southeastern Mesoamerican languages; that its diffusion into Mayan languages took place between about 200 B.C. and A.D. 400; and that it spread from a Mije-Sokean language in or near the Basin of Mexico into languages in the region. It shows that each of the arguments presented by Dakin and Wichmann (2000) against a Mije-Sokean origin is either unworkable, is based upon false premises, or is not relevant; and that their proposed alternative – that it originated in and spread from Nawa into other Mesoamerican languages – conflicts with the mass of evidence relevant to the issue. This study also discusses the linguistic details of vocabulary for drinks made from cacao; shows that no proposed etymology for the word chocolate is correct, but agrees with Dakin and Wichmann that its proximate source is a Nawa form chikola:tl; and discusses the history of words for Theobroma bicolor (‘Nicaragua chocolate tree; pataxte’) and their use. The linguistic data are pertinent to issues of intergroup interaction in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, but do not shed light on the nature or the cultural context of the diffusion of cacao in Mesoamerica, nor on its uses.},

We present a transdisciplinary case study that combines archeological, historical, and paleoclimate datasets to explore the dynamic, shifting relationships among climate change, civil conflict, and political collapse at Mayapan, the largest Postclassic Maya capital of the Yucatán Peninsula in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries CE. Multiple data sources indicate that civil conflict increased significantly and generalized linear modeling correlates strife in the city with drought conditions between 1400 and 1450\,cal. CE. We argue that prolonged drought escalated rival factional tensions, but subsequent adaptations reveal regional-scale resiliency, ensuring that Maya political and economic structures endured until European contact in the early sixteenth century CE.},

After four years of growing plants under glass in his London home, Ward created traveling glazed cases that he hoped would be able to transport plants around the world. After a test run from London to Sydney, Ward was proven correct and the Wardian case was born. It is easy to forget in our technologically advanced and globalized world, but prior to the invention of the case it was extremely difficult to transfer plants around the globe, as they often died from mishandling, cold weather, or salt from the ocean. In this enthralling book, Luke Keogh takes us around the world and through history with the Wardian case. He shows that this revolution in the movement of plants transformed the world, impacting the commercial nursery trade, late nineteenth century imperialism, and the global environment. The repercussions of this revolution are still with us today"--},

  abstract = {"As societies across the globe are becoming increasingly interwoven at an unprecedented speed and across an impressive scope, so too is the world of food, allowing the English language to develop an ever-widening culinary vocabulary. This book examines the lives of such words in today's discourse on eating and drinking, focusing on foreign - particularly East Asian - influences on culinary terms in English, and how words are born and evolve in a modern transcultural environment. Through the lens of culinary words, this book demonstrates that foreign-origin and hybrid words, previously considered marginal, have become a main source of new imports into our daily lexicon. With case studies from Japan to Mongolia, Hong Kong to Korea, China to Vietnam, and beyond, this book examines how more and more words are becoming borderless and forming their own new global identities. By showcasing some lesser-known regional cuisines, alongside staple dishes that many of us already know and love, this book offers a wide range of examples in order to illustrate the metamorphosis of the manner in which we engage with food words. This book will be of interest to general readers, as well as those who are engaged in East Asian studies, English linguistics, intercultural communication studies, translation studies and lexicography"–},

  abstract = {Saffron (Crocus sativus L.) is the most expensive spice of the world, and it is one of the 85 members of the genus Crocus. It is native of Asia Minor, and it is cultivated in Mediterranean countries. Saffron predominantly contains certain chemical constituents that are responsible for imparting colour, flavour, and aroma. Some of its components have cytotoxic, anti-carcinogenic and anti-tumor properties. Since, saffron is a triploid (2n = 3x = 24) plant and fails to produce seed upon selfing or crossing, so it is propagated through corms. The growing area for saffron is not extensive, although its demand in the international market is increasing. Research activities have been initiated to develop new production technologies of this spice in many countries. Saffron grows best in friable, loose, low-density, well-watered, and well-drained clay calcareous soils. Besides, climate and soil, planting time, seed/corm rate, planting depth, corm size/weight, crop density, nutrient management, weed management, growth regulators, harvest, and post-harvest management also influence saffron quality and quantity. In this paper, an attempt has been made to compile the recent agronomic research on saffron for commercial flower and corm production.},

That's how David McCullough described Mark Kurlansky's Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World, a work that revealed how a meal can be as important as it is edible. Salt: A World History, its successor, did the same for a seasoning, and confirmed Kurlansky as one of our most erudite and entertaining food authors. Now, the winner of the James Beard Award for Excellence in Food Writing shares a varied selection of "choice cuts" by others, as he leads us on a mouthwatering culinary tour around the world and through history and culture from the fifth century B.C. to the present day. Choice Cuts features more than two hundred pieces, from Cato to Cab Calloway. Here are essays by Plato on the art of cooking ... Pablo Neruda on french fries ... Alice B. Toklas on killing a carp ... M.F.K. Fisher on the virility of Turkish desserts ... Alexandre Dumas on coffee ... W.H. Auden on Icelandic food ... Elizabeth David on the downward march of English pizza ... Claude LEvi-Strauss on "the idea of rotten" ... James Beard on scrambled eggs ... Balzac, Virginia Woolf, E.M. Forster, Chekhov, and many other famous gourmands and gourmets, accomplished cooks, or just plain ravenous writers on the passions of cuisine},

  abstract = {Scientific Narrative Psychology integrates quantitative methodologies into the study of identity. Its methodology, Narrative Categorical Analysis, and its toolkit, NarrCat, were both originally developed by the Hungarian Narrative Psychology Group. NarrCat is for machine-made transformation of sentences in self-narratives into psychologically relevant, statistically processable narrative categories. The main body of this flexible and comprehensive system is formed by Psycho-Thematic modules, such as Agency, Evaluation, Emotion, Cognition, Spatiality, and Temporality. The Relational Modules include Social References, Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), and Negation. Certain elements can be combined into Hypermodules, such as Psychological Perspective and Spatio-Temporal Perspective, which allow for even more complex, higher level exploration of composite psychological processes. Using up-to-date developments of corpus linguistics and Natural Language Processing (NLP), a unique feature of NarrCat is its capacity of SRL. The structure of NarrCat, as well as the empirical results in group identity research, is discussed.},

Recently, increased interest in spices prompted the development of an updated dried spice and herb aroma wheel, the original of which was created at McCormick and Company, Inc. (McCormick) during the mid-1990s. The new version of the McCormick Spice Wheel (MSW) was generated from lexicons developed at McCormick, a sample of which were validated to still be appropriate through cluster analysis, principal component analysis and correlations. The final spice* wheel was validated by a team of sensory scientists (n = 5) including panel leaders (n = 3) and a group of trained descriptive panelists (n = 9). The final MSW has 17 categories and 56 attributes.},

  abstract = {Many defended animals prevent attacks by displaying warning signals that are highly conspicuous to their predators. We hypothesized that bioluminescing fireflies, widely known for their vibrant courtship signals, also advertise their noxiousness to echolocating bats. To test this postulate, we pit naïve big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) against chemically defended fireflies (Photinus pyralis) to examine whether and how these beetles transmit salient warnings to bats. We demonstrate that these nocturnal predators learn to avoid noxious fireflies using either vision or echolocation and that bats learn faster when integrating information from both sensory streams—providing fundamental evidence that multisensory integration increases the efficacy of warning signals in a natural predator-prey system. Our findings add support for a warning signal origin of firefly bioluminescence and suggest that bat predation may have driven evolution of firefly bioluminescence.},

We examine the SpokenBNC, a corpus of around 11.4 million words of British English conversations and identify behavioural differences between speakers that are labelled for gender and age categories. We explore differences in language use and turn-taking dynamics and identify a range of characteristics that set the categories apart. We find that female speakers tend to produce more and slightly longer turns, while turns by male speakers feature a higher type-token ratio and a distinct range of minimal particles such as “eh”, “uh” and “em”. Across age groups, we observe, for instance, that swear words and laughter characterize young speakers’ talk, while old speakers tend to produce more truncated words. We then use the observed characteristics to predict gender and age labels of speakers per conversation and per turn as a classification task, showing that non-lexical utterances such as minimal particles that are usually left out of dialog data can contribute to setting the categories apart.},

During the last half-century or so dedicated scholars such as Pelliot have devoted their major research efforts to the meticulous consideration of the minutiae involved in the subject; and, more recently, Joseph Needham has contrived both to continue the work of such predecessors and to draw some of the major conclusions that are the fruits of basic research conducted in several disciplines. Probably the full story of these exchanges can never be told; for the evidence is sadly deficient; balanced inferences that rely on information gathered from both East and West are rarely possible; and, maddeningly enough, the political restrictions of the 20th century now prevent the application of the modern techniques of archaeology, geography, and anthropology in areas where they are most likely to be successful.},

Based on the corpus, we find some tendency among synaesthetic transfers of these 15 adjectives. The first important finding is related to the directionality of synaesthetic transfers, that is, the transfer direction is mostly from the gustatory sense to both tactile and olfactory senses, and from the tactile sense to the olfactory sense, while the reverse direction is rare. Another interesting tendency is the priority of synaesthesia over the embodied metaphor. Our data shows that sensory adjectives that have synaesthetic distributions tend to also have distributions in embodied metaphors, but not vice versa.},

However, accumulating evidence indicates that T2Rs are widely expressed throughout the body and mediate diverse nontasting roles through various specialized mechanisms. It has also become apparent that T2Rs and their polymorphisms are associated with human disorders. In this review, we summarize the physiological and pathophysiological roles that extraoral T2Rs play in processes as diverse as innate immunity and reproduction, and the major challenges in this emerging field.},

This study not only propose a model to identify and classify inclusion in language use, but also provides insights to measure and track progress by including inclusion in CSR reports as a strategy to build an inclusive corporate team.},

Many researches and publications deal with the ancient incense trade, but only a few focus on this trade during the Islamic period. This paper aims to present the results obtained from a multidisciplinary methodology. To identify the main substances used as incense, medieval Arabic sources such as the Kitāb al-nabāt written by Al-AsmacI and Abū Hanīfah al-Dlnawarl, or Ibn al-Baytâr's al-Jãmic li-mufradāt al-adwiyyah wa-H-aghdhiyyah are of great interest. These textual sources are compared to modern botanical studies and chemical analyses of the substances found in archaeological contexts.},

  abstract = {Powerful figures, such as politicians, who show a behavioural pattern of exuberant self-confidence, recklessness, and contempt for others may be the subject of the acquired personality disorder, the hubris syndrome, which has been demonstrated to leave its mark on speech patterns. Our study explores characteristic language patterns of Hungarian prime ministers (PMs) with a special emphasis on one of the key indicators of hubris, the shift from the first person “I” to “we” in spontaneous speech. We analyzed the ratio of the first-person singular (“I”) and plural (“we”) pronouns and verbal inflections in the spontaneous parliamentary speeches of four Hungarian PMs between 1998–2018. We found that Viktor Orba´ n during his second premiership (2010–2014) used first person plural relative to singular inflections more often than the other three PMs during their terms. Orba´ n and another Hungarian PM, Ferenc Gyurcsa´ ny, who were re-elected at some point showed an increased ratio of first-person plural vs. singular inflections and personal pronouns by their second term, likely reflecting increasing hubristic tendencies. The results show that the ratio of “I” and “we” usually studied in English texts also show changes in a structurally different language, Hungarian. This finding suggests that it is extended periods of premiership that may increase hubristic behaviour in political leaders, not only experiencing excessive power. The results are particularly elucidating regarding the role of re-elections in political leaders’ hubristic speech–and behaviour.},

Manning offers a major new history of economic life in the Mediterranean world in the Iron Age, from Phoenician trading down to the Hellenistic era and the beginning of Rome's imperial supremacy. Drawing on a wide range of ancient sources and the latest social theory, Manning suggests that a search for an illusory single "ancient economy" has obscured the diversity of lived experience in the Mediterranean world, including both changes in political economies over time and differences in cultural conceptions of property and money. At the same time, he shows how the region's economies became increasingly interconnected during this period.   {$<$}em{$>$}The Open Sea{$<$}/em{$>$} argues that the keys to understanding the region's rapid social and economic change during the Iron Age are the variety of economic and political solutions its different cultures devised, the patterns of cross-cultural exchange, and the sharp environmental contrasts between Egypt, the Near East, and Greece and Rome. The book examines long-run drivers of change, such as climate, together with the most important economic institutions of the premodern Mediterranean--coinage, money, agriculture, and private property. It also explores the role of economic growth, states, and legal institutions in the region's various economies.   A groundbreaking economic history of the ancient Mediterranean world,{$<$}em{$>$}The Open Sea{$<$}/em{$>$} shows that the origins of the modern economy extend far beyond Greece and Rome.},

  abstract = {The time interval from the 9th to the 13th century remained known as the “Golden period of the Arab science”, and a significant place among the taught sciences are occupied by Medicine and Pharmacy. In the history of medicine, Islamic medicine, also known as Arabic medicine, refers to the science of medicine developed in the Islamic Golden Age, and written in Arabic Arabs were able to use their cultural and natural resources and trade links to contribute to the strong development of pharmacy. After the collapse of the Arab rule, the Arab territorial expanses and cultural heritage were taken over by the Turks. Although scientific progress in the Turkish period slowed down due to numerous unfavorable political-economic and other circumstances, thanks to the Turks, Arab culture and useful Islamic principles expanded to the territory of our homeland of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Significant role in the transfer of Arabic medical and pharmaceutical knowledge was also attributed to the Sephardic Jews who, with their arrival, continued to perform their attar activities, which were largely based on Arab achievements. However, insufficiently elaborated, rich funds of oriental medical and pharmaceutical handwriting testify that Oriental science has nurtured in these areas as well, and that the Arab component in a specific way was intertwined with other cultures and traditions of Bosnia and Herzegovina.},

  abstract = {Medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) have accompanied mankind from its very early beginnings. Their utilization has co-evolved with homo sapiens itself. Evolution has brought about a profound increase in our scientific knowledge about these species, so that, to date, they find utilization in many facets of our life (eg. pharmaceutical products, feed- and food additives, cosmetics, etc.). Remarkably today, despite the new renaissance of MAPs usage, ca. 80 \% of the world's population relies upon natural substances of plant origin, with most of these botanicals sourced from the wild state. This huge increase in demand has put an unparalleled large burden on the natural resources of MAPs endangering their existence. The first volume of the series Medicinal Plants of the World, will briefly summarize the most essential current scientific knowledge about the sustainable sourcing of botanicals from both wild-crafting and cultivation. In these 21 chapters, eminent researchers of the topic will summarize latest scientific knowledge from the versatile and most varied scientific disciplines involved: botany, phytochemistry, plant breeding, biotechnology, agrotechnology, mechanization and economics. Individual chapters will deal with the essentials of phytomedical utilization, as well as utilization in the form of animal feed-additives. The volume concludes with a chapter on the poisonous MAPs in our homes, offices and modern everyday environments. The aim of this volume is to offer basic scientific information on MAPs. It will also enable readers of subsequent volumes to digest and interpret the other volumes in the series, that will deal with important and characteristic wild-crafted and cultivated MAPs of the different geographic and climatic regions of the world. Thus, the series is meant to be a storehouse of up-to-date information on our global wealth of medicinal and aromatic plants on the basis of which MAPs will be collected, cultivated, traded and utilized in a sustainable way.},

By giving illustrative examples and many practical tips, they let the reader participate in their vast experience in this quickly evolving field of research.”–Gregor Wiedemann, University of Hamburg, Germany This book presents established and state-of-the-art methods in Language Technology (including text mining, corpus linguistics, computational linguistics, and natural language processing), and demonstrates how they can be applied by humanities scholars working with textual data. The landscape of humanities research has recently changed thanks to the proliferation of big data and large textual collections such as Google Books, Early English Books Online, and Project Gutenberg. These resources have yet to be fully explored by new generations of scholars, and the authors argue that Language Technology has a key role to play in the exploration of large-scale textual data. The authors use a series of illustrative examples from various humanistic disciplines (mainly but not exclusively from History, Classics, and Literary Studies) to demonstrate basic and more complex use-case scenarios. This book will be useful to graduate students and researchers in humanistic disciplines working with textual data, including History, Modern Languages, Literary studies, Classics, and Linguistics. This is also a very useful book for anyone teaching or learning Digital Humanities and interested in the basic concepts from computational linguistics, corpus linguistics, and natural language processing. Barbara McGillivray is a Turing Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge and The Alan Turing Institute, UK. She has published two monographs, Methods in Latin Computational Linguistics (2014) and Quantitative Historical Linguistics. A corpus framework (2017).

  abstract = {This paper aims to achieve two goals: the first is to bring a fresh perspective to the Atlanto-centric history of Chinese propaganda while tracing the roots of SinoHungarian bilateral approaches and Hungarian Sinology to a time dating some fifteen years earlier than the mutual recognition of the two People’s Republics. This analysis also introduces three actors of different political agendas who applied a similar PR tool of cultural diplomacy to elicit international sympathy for their homeland. After briefly surveying the primary stimuli of cultural diplomacy in interwar Hungary and RepublicanEra China, I turn to pre-1949 Sino-Hungarian cultural approaches in the era of no formal diplomatic relations. Such initiatives offer valuable insights into the history of cultural diplomacy while also highlighting significant parallels with the present. Specifically, I introduce the political and cultural agenda of three individuals acting as cultural ambassadors to their homelands. The Shanghai Jewish refugee aid organizer, Paul Komor, and the women’s association president, Theresia Moll, were members of the Hungarian diaspora in China. They introduced the post-Habsburg Central European region to a cosmopolitan community while exhibiting two different foci: Hungarian irredentism and pan-Danubianism. Meanwhile, Zhenya He, a Kuomintang propagandist and the University of Budapest’s first Chinese language instructor during the 1930s, synthesized Hungarian pan-Asian Turanism with Sun Yat-sen’s Tridemism to further Sino-Hungarian exchanges.},

  abstract = {To enrich vocabulary of low resource settings, we proposed a novel method which identify loanwords in monolingual corpora. More specifically, we first use cross-lingual word embeddings as the core feature to generate semantically related candidates based on comparable corpora and a small bilingual lexicon; then, a log-linear model which combines several shallow features such as pronunciation similarity and hybrid language model features to predict the final results. In this paper, we use Uyghur as the receipt language and try to detect loanwords in four donor languages: Arabic, Chinese, Persian and Russian. We conduct two groups of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach: loanword identification and OOV translation in four language pairs and eight translation directions (Uyghur-Arabic, ArabicUyghur, Uyghur-Chinese, Chinese-Uyghur, Uyghur-Persian, Persian-Uyghur, Uyghur-Russian, and Russian-Uyghur). Experimental results on loanword identification show that our method outperforms other baseline models significantly. Neural machine translation models integrating results of loanword identification experiments achieve the best results on OOV translation(with 0.5-0.9 BLEU improvements).},

  abstract = {Research into early Chinese olfactory culture is only just beginning. This paper argues that before the arrival of Buddhism, elite scent culture had already begun to be transformed by the importation of foreign aromatics, though these substances arrived shorn of their original cultural context. Prior to the importing of intense foreign perfumes, the aromatics available were mostly local, and traditional Chinese practice stressed the use of individual scents in religious contexts, a concept which also had a profound influence on secular usage. The same is true of early osmographies, which link particular kinds of smells–including many that might be considered unpleasant–to the changing seasons. When foreign spices and aromatics arrived in China for the first time, a phenomenon later literature specifically associates with the reign of Han Wudi, this resulted in the development of new complex and powerful perfumes. This in turn may have had a significant impact upon the material culture of Han China, with the spread of personal scenting devices and incense burners.

  abstract = {"Zhao Feiyan (45-1 BCE), the second empress appointed by Emperor Cheng of the Han dynasty (207 BCE-220 CE), was born in slavery and trained in the performing arts, a background that made her appointment as empress highly controversial. Subsequent persecution by her political enemies eventually led to her being forced to commit suicide. After her death, her reputation was marred by accusations of vicious scheming, murder of other consorts and their offspring, and relentless promiscuity, punctuated by bouts of extravagant shopping. This first book-length study of Zhao Feiyan and her literary legacy includes a complete translation of The Scandalous Tale of Zhao Feiyan (Zhao Feiyan waizhuan), a Tang dynasty (618-907 CE) erotic novella that describes in great detail the decadent lifestyle enjoyed by imperial favorites in the harem of Emperor Cheng. This landmark text was crucial for establishing writings about palace women as the accepted forum for discussing sexual matters, including fetishism, obsession, jealousy, incompatibility in marriage, and so on. Using historical documentation, Olivia Milburn reconstructs the evolution of Zhao Feiyan's story and illuminates the broader context of palace life for women and the novella's social influence"--},

  abstract = {In the history of the development of human civilization, the Silk Road has been an important route of traffic and exchange between the East and the West. From Zhang Qian’s 張騫\,opening up of the Silk Road across the Western Regions (Xiyue 西域) to Zheng He’s 鄭和\,sailing to the Western Oceans (xia xiyang 下西洋) more than 1500 years later, China had a continuous desire to explore beyond its borders. At the time of Zheng He, the term “Western Oceans” (xiyang 西 洋 ) had a specific meaning. As shown by the account of Ma Huan 馬歡, who personally joined Zheng He on the voyages, the people of Ming China considered the “Western Oceans” to be the Namoli Ocean (Namoli yang 那没黎洋), later called the Indian Ocean. Thus, it could be concluded that the Western Oceans where Zheng He’s fleet went meant the Indian Ocean. Even today most scholars still divide the Eastern and Western Oceans at Brunei, with no clear understanding of where the Western Oceans to which Zheng He sailed were actually located. It is therefore important to make clear that the Western Oceans in his time referred to the Indian Ocean, before moving on to investigate the purpose of the voyages and related historical issues. Even more important is to point out that Zheng He’s expeditions in the early fifteenth century reflected that Chinese people took to the seas on a scale larger than ever before and joined the maritime and overland silk routes together. The place where this occurred was the Indian Ocean.},

But as the vast Roman Empire disintegrated, so did appreciation of these precious texts. Christianity cast a shadow over so-called pagan thought, books were burned, and the library of Alexandria, the greatest repository of classical knowledge, was destroyed. Yet some texts did survive and The Map of Knowledge explores the role played by seven cities around the Mediterranean--rare centers of knowledge in a dark world, where scholars supported by enlightened heads of state collected, translated and shared manuscripts. In 8th century Baghdad, Arab discoveries augmented Greek learning. Exchange within the thriving Muslim world brought that knowledge to Cordoba, Spain. Toledo became a famous center of translation from Arabic into Latin, a portal through which Greek and Arab ideas reached Western Europe. Salerno, on the Italian coast, was the great center of medical studies, and Sicily, ancient colony of the Greeks, was one of the few places in the West to retain contact with Greek culture and language. Scholars in these cities helped classical ideas make their way to Venice in the 15th century, where printers thrived and the Renaissance took root. The Map of Knowledge follows three key texts--Euclid's Elements, Ptolemy's The Almagest, and Galen's writings on medicine--on a perilous journey driven by insatiable curiosity about the world"--},

Tying the ingredients of our diet evolution to the growth of human civilization, he immerses readers in the passionate debates and bold inventions that transformed food from a simple staple to a potent factor in health and a symbol of social and ideological standing. Montanari returns to the prestigious Salerno school of medicine, the "mother of all medical schools," to plot the theory of food that took shape in the twelfth century. He reviews the influence of the Near Eastern spice routes, which introduced new flavors and cooking techniques to European kitchens, and reads Europe's earliest cookbooks, which took cues from old Roman practices that valued artifice and mixed flavors. Dishes were largely low-fat, and meats and fish were seasoned with vinegar, citrus juices, and wine. He highlights other dishes, habits, and battles that mirror contemporary culinary identity, including the refinement of pasta, polenta, bread, and other flour-based foods; the transition to more advanced cooking tools and formal dining implements; the controversy over cooking with oil, lard, or butter; dietary regimens; and the consumption and cultural meaning of water and wine. As people became more cognizant of their physicality, individuality, and place in the cosmos, Montanari shows, they adopted a new attitude toward food, investing as much in its pleasure and possibilities as in its acquisition."--Jacket},

  abstract = {In the West, we have identified only four basic tastes--sour, sweet, salty, and bitter--that, through skillful combination and technique, create delicious foods. Yet in many parts of East Asia over the past century, an additional flavor has entered the culinary lexicon: umami, a fifth taste impression that is savory, complex, and wholly distinct. Combining culinary history with recent research into the chemistry, preparation, nutrition, and culture of food, the authors encapsulate what we know to date about the concept of umami, from ancient times to today. Umami can be found in soup stocks, meat dishes, air-dried ham, shellfish, aged cheeses, mushrooms, and ripe tomatoes, and it can enhance other taste substances to produce a transformative gustatory experience. Researchers have also discovered which substances in foodstuffs bring out umami, a breakthrough that allows any casual cook to prepare delicious and more nutritious meals with less fat, salt, and sugar. The implications of harnessing umami are both sensuous and social, enabling us to become more intimate with the subtleties of human taste while making better food choices for ourselves and our families. This volume, the product of an ongoing collaboration between a chef and a scientist, won the Danish national Mad+Medier-Prisen (Food and Media Award) in the category of academic food communication. -- From publisher's website},

The book surveys a wide range of examples of changes in the structure, function and vitality of languages, and suggests that similar ecologies have played the same kinds of roles in all cases of language evolution. Drawing on major theories of language formation, macroecology and population genetics, Mufwene proposes a common approach to the development of creoles and other new languages.

  abstract = {This paper shows the processes that loanwords undergo when they are adapted from Arabic into Kiwahili. The data used is from Bosha (1993) and a constraint-based analysis is used in this paper. Although a number of studies have been carried out on Kiswahili loanwords, none that I know of has used Optimality Theory. This therefore makes the paper different from the others. Issues tackled herein include pitting the faithfulness of Kiswahili’s open syllabicity (NOCODA) against the markedness of the sonority hierarchy (SON-SEQ) in borrowed words. For example, the paper discusses whether to maintain NOCODA when syllabifying “sultani” (chief, ruler, king) as /su.lta.ni/ or whether to look at the sonority of /l/ and /t/ vis-a-vis syllable margin (SONSEQ) and thus syllabify it as /sul.ta.ni/. Occasionally in casual speech this is resolved by inserting a vowel between the consonants thus producing /su.lu.ta.ni/, but at other times prestige overrides well-formedness. Furthermore, this paper also shows that Kiswahili mainly uses vowel epenthesis to repair syllables but other procedures like consonant deletion, cluster tolerance and feature change are also used. It has also been confirmed that Kiswahili is susceptible to consonant clusters within syllables because of its long association with non-Bantu languages, mainly Arabic and English.},

  abstract = {Gary Paul Nabhan takes the reader on a vivid and far-ranging journey across time and space in this fascinating look at the relationship between the spice trade and culinary imperialism. Drawing on his own family's history as spice traders, as well as travel narratives, historical accounts, and his expertise as an ethnobotanist, Nabhan describes the critical roles that Semitic peoples and desert floras had in setting the stage for globalized spice trade.Traveling along four prominent trade routes-the Silk Road, the Frankincense Trail, the Spice Route, and the Camino Real (for chiles and chocolate)-Nabhan follows the caravans of itinerant spice merchants from the frankincense-gathering grounds and ancient harbors of the Arabian Peninsula to the port of Zayton on the China Sea to Santa Fe in the southwest United States. His stories, recipes, and linguistic analyses of cultural diffusion routes reveal the extent to which aromatics such as cumin, cinnamon, saffron, and peppers became adopted worldwide as signature ingredients of diverse cuisines.{$<$}em{$>$}Cumin, Camels, and Caravans{$<$}/em{$>$}demonstrates that two particular desert cultures often depicted in constant conflict-Arabs and Jews-have spent much of their history collaborating in the spice trade and suggests how a more virtuous multicultural globalized society may be achieved in the future.},

  abstract = {Medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) have accompanied mankind from its very early beginnings. Their utilization has co-evolved with homo sapiens itself. Evolution has brought about a profound increase in our scientific knowledge about these species, so that, to date, they find utilization in many facets of our life (eg. pharmaceutical products, feed- and food additives, cosmetics, etc.). Remarkably today, despite the new renaissance of MAPs usage, ca. 80 \% of the world's population relies upon natural substances of plant origin, with most of these botanicals sourced from the wild state. This huge increase in demand has put an unparalleled large burden on the natural resources of MAPs endangering their existence. The first volume of the series Medicinal Plants of the World, will briefly summarize the most essential current scientific knowledge about the sustainable sourcing of botanicals from both wild-crafting and cultivation. In these 21 chapters, eminent researchers of the topic will summarize latest scientific knowledge from the versatile and most varied scientific disciplines involved: botany, phytochemistry, plant breeding, biotechnology, agrotechnology, mechanization and economics. Individual chapters will deal with the essentials of phytomedical utilization, as well as utilization in the form of animal feed-additives. The volume concludes with a chapter on the poisonous MAPs in our homes, offices and modern everyday environments. The aim of this volume is to offer basic scientific information on MAPs. It will also enable readers of subsequent volumes to digest and interpret the other volumes in the series, that will deal with important and characteristic wild-crafted and cultivated MAPs of the different geographic and climatic regions of the world. Thus, the series is meant to be a storehouse of up-to-date information on our global wealth of medicinal and aromatic plants on the basis of which MAPs will be collected, cultivated, traded and utilized in a sustainable way.},

  abstract = {The question of how to reconstruct the Proto-Indo-European plosive inventory has received much attention in recent decades. The traditional reconstruction with four series (D D\textsuperscript{h} T T\textsuperscript{h}, Brugmann 1904: § 261)¹ was abandoned by many because several occurrences of T\textsuperscript{h} could be reconstructed as arising from T plus laryngeal. The resulting inventory with three series (D D\textsuperscript{h} T, see especially Lehmann 1955: § 13.1) was shown to be typologically problematical (Pedersen 1951, Jakobson 1958). Alternative inventories were proposed replacing the traditional mediae by a different series, often glottalic, and adjusting the remaining series to this move.² Thus, Hopper (1973, 1977a},

  abstract = {Vegetables are the most important sources of phenolics in the Mediterranean diet. Phenolics, especially flavonoids, are suggested as being essential bioactive compounds providing health benefits. In this study, twenty-seven vegetables, fifteen aromatic herbs and some spices consumed in Central Italy (the Marches region) were studied to reveal total phenolic, flavonoid and flavanol content as well as their antioxidant capacity measured by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method. A comparison in terms of antioxidant capacity was made between different salads, as well as between salads to which aromatic herbs had been added. Lemon balm and marjoram at a concentration of 1·5 \% w/w increased by 150 \% and 200 \% respectively the antioxidant capacity of a salad portion. A 200 g portion of a salad enriched with marjoram corresponded to an intake of 200 (sd 10) mg phenolics and 4000 (sd 300) ORAC units (μmol Trolox equivalents). Olive oils and wine or apple vinegars were the salad dressings that provided the highest increase in antioxidant capacity. Among the spices tested, cumin and fresh ginger made the most significant contribution to the antioxidant capacity. The results are useful in surveying the antioxidant parameters of vegetables, herbs and spices produced and consumed in our geographical area as well as in quantifying the daily intake of phenolics and ORAC units. The results can be used in public health campaigns to stimulate the consumption of vegetables able to provide significant health protection in order to prevent chronic diseases.},

  abstract = {The role of bitter taste—one of the few basic taste modalities—is commonly assumed to signal toxicity and alert animals against consuming harmful compounds. However, it is known that some toxic compounds are not bitter and that many bitter compounds have negligible toxicity while having important health benefits. Here we apply a quantitative analysis of the chemical space to shed light on the bitterness-toxicity relationship. Using the BitterDB dataset of bitter molecules, The BitterPredict prediction tool, and datasets of toxic compounds, we quantify the identity and similarity between bitter and toxic compounds. About 60\% of the bitter compounds have documented toxicity and only 56\% of the toxic compounds are known or predicted to be bitter. The LD50 value distributions suggest that most of the bitter compounds are not very toxic, but there is a somewhat higher chance of toxicity for known bitter compounds compared to known nonbitter ones. Flavonoids and alpha acids are more common in the bitter dataset compared with the toxic dataset. In contrast, alkaloids are more common in the toxic datasets compared to the bitter dataset. Interestingly, no trend linking LD50 values with the number of activated bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs) subtypes is apparent in the currently available data. This is in accord with the newly discovered expression of TAS2Rs in several extra-oral tissues, in which they might be activated by yet unknown endogenous ligands and play nongustatory physiological roles. These results suggest that bitter taste is not a very reliable marker for toxicity, and is likely to have other physiological roles. VC 2017 IUBMB Life, 69(12):938–946, 2017},

  abstract = {"This volume describes the social and practical aspects of Islamic mysticism (Sufism) across centuries and geographical regions. Its authors seek to transcend ethereal, essentialist and "spiritualizing" approaches to Sufism, on the one hand, and purely pragmatic and materialistic explanations of its origins and history, on the other. Covering five topics (Sufism's economy, social role of Sufis, Sufi spaces, politics, and organization), the volume shows that mystics have been active socio-religious agents who could skillfully adjust to the conditions of their time and place, while also managing to forge an alternative way of living, worshiping and thinking. Basing themselves on the most recent research on Sufi institutions, the contributors to this volume substantially expand our understanding of the vicissitudes of Sufism by paying special attention to its organizational and economic dimensions, as well as complex and often ambivalent relations between Sufis and the societies in which they played a wide variety of important and sometimes critical roles. Contributors are Mehran Afshari, Ismail Fajrie Alatas, Semih Ceyhan, Rachida Chih, Nathalie Clayer, David Cook, Stéphane A.

Since the nature of corpus data and corpus techniques makes the two sections very field-specific, we then focus more particularly on the “Methods” and “Discussion” sections of a typical quantitative corpus linguistic paper. We provide recommendations that span the research cycle from data description to analyzing the dataset and reporting the results of statistical tests.},

  abstract = {This pilot study attempts a novel compari­ son on how metaphors of BITTERNESS are used in English and Mandarin Chinese, in or­ der to identify subtle cross­linguistic differ­ ences. Using dictionary definitions and Word­ Net databases, we conduct a lexical semantic analysis and establish the various senses “bit­ ter words” can convey. Then, with the help of corpus data we explore the typical themes and contexts the two languages utilize sensory words related to this concept. We observed that figurative uses of bitter in English tend to revolve around ANIMOSITY, while Chinese 苦 ku3 ‘bitter’ frequently expresses SUFFER­ ING. Due to the displeasing character of this human taste experience, conceptualizations of BITTERNESS are overwhelmingly negative. However, we also found that BITTERNESS does not always transmit negative polarity, ex­ pressions such as “a bitter pill to swallow” and “良藥苦口 good medicine tastes bitter” carry an evaluative positivity. Related to linguistic synaesthesia, we found that bitter in English has origins in the tactile sensory domain, and channels this modality when used as a con­ ceptual metaphor for HARSHNESS, describ­ ing colds and winds, or sometimes words.},

  abstract = {Taste usually occupies the bottom of the sensorial hierarchy, as the quintessentially hedonistic sense, too close to the animal, the elemental and the corporeal, and for this reason disciplined and moralised. At the same time, taste is indissolubly tied to knowledge. To taste is to discriminate, emit judgement, enter an unstable domain of synaesthetic normativity where the certainty of metaphysical categories begins to crumble. This second title in the ‘Law and the Senses’ series explores law using taste as a conceptual and ontological category able to unsettle legal certainties, and a promising tool whereby to investigate the materiality of law’s relation to the world. For what else is law’s reduction of the world into legal categories, if not law’s ingesting the world by tasting it, and emitting moral and legal judgements accordingly? Through various topics including coffee, wine, craft cider and Japanese knotweed, this volume explores the normativities that shape the way taste is felt and categorised, within and beyond subjective, phenomenological and human dimensions. The result is an original interdisciplinary volume – complete with seven speculative ‘recipes’ – dedicated to a rarely explored intersection, with contributions from artists, legal academics, philosophers, anthropologists and sociologists.},

  abstract = {The purpose of my research is to understand the meaning behind Japanese bread among Japanese people. Although bread is not something native to Japan, the Japanese have for over five hundred years made improvements to bread so it would become palatable to themselves. In the end Japanese people succeeded in creating bread specific to Japan— “Japanese bread”. However, because Japanese bread has been generated specifically for the Japanese, it is not something common in rest of the world. This fact makes it difficult for the Japanese living abroad to obtain Japanese bread amid increasing globalization.    Material collected between February and September 2015 during fieldwork conducted among Japanese people in San Diego, CA, for this study, reveals that most people have begun baking Japanese bread on their own as a result of seeking the bread that can satisfy their appetites. Even though everyone has different motives and goals for bread baking, Japanese women specifically share common features in their baking. Japanese bread baking is not simply for indulging their appetite for Japanese bread but for fulfilling a role as Japanese women. Viewed from the understanding of the traditional notion of “good wives, wise mothers” representing self-sacrifice and devotion to family, Japanese wives and mothers make an effort to learn and bake bread to feed the best food to their families.   A larger aim of this research is to contribute to the field of folklore, especially the study of material culture. The study of foodways and other genres of material culture share the directions and theories of folklore scholarship. Different from other genres of material culture showing the individuals’ identity through subcultural objects, scholars in food studies tend to address staple foods as a source of symbolism in a given culture and the emergence of a cultural identity or a group’s identity through such food. To expand this tradition, I have shown the intimate connection between the Japanese and bread as non-staple food of the Japanese in the individual level by interpreting individuals’ raw voices gathered during fieldwork.},

The connection between man and his search for drugs in nature dates from the far past, of which there is ample evidence from various sources: written documents, preserved monuments, and even original plant medicines. Awareness of medicinal plants usage is a result of the many years of struggles against illnesses due to which man learned to pursue drugs in barks, seeds, fruit bodies, and other parts of the plants. Contemporary science has acknowledged their active action, and it has included in modern pharmacotherapy a range of drugs of plant origin, known by ancient civilizations and used throughout the millennia. The knowledge of the development of ideas related to the usage of medicinal plants as well as the evolution of awareness has increased the ability of pharmacists and physicians to respond to the challenges that have emerged with the spreading of professional services in facilitation of man's life.},

  abstract = {"Marco Polo was the most famous traveller of his time. His voyages began in 1271 with a visit to China, after which he served the Kublai Khan on numerous diplomatic missions. On his return to the West he was made a prisoner of war and met Rustichello of Pisa, with whom he collaborated on this book. His account of his travels offers a fascinating glimpse of what he encountered abroad: unfamiliar religions, customs and societies; the spices and silks of the East; the precious gems, exotic vegetation and wild beasts of faraway lands. Evoking a remote and long-vanished world with colour and immediacy, Marco's book revolutionized western ideas about the then unknown East and is still one of the greatest travel accounts of all time. For this edition - the first completely new English translation of the Travels in over fifty years - Nigel Cliff has gone back to the original manuscript sources to produce a fresh, authoritative new version. The volume also contains ... an introduction describing the world as it stood on the eve of Polo's departure, and examining the fantastical notions the West had developed of the East"--Publisher's description},

  abstract = {"For hundreds of years, into the twentieth century, the culture groups in the areas we now know as China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam shared a great many political and social values, religious beliefs, and artistic and literary traditions. These common cultural features were recorded and transmitted in the same basic written language-classical or literary Chinese (known as guwen/wenyan in China, Kanbun in Japan, Hanmun in Korea, and Hánvan in Vietnam). The umbrella term for this shared language is "literary Sinitic"-a term designed to recognize the fact that although guwen/wenyan originally developed in China, it had a vibrant life of its own in other areas of East Asia (i.e., what this study terms the Sinosphere). This huge but understudied body of written documents offers extraordinarily rich resources for examining issues of cultural continuity and change in this important region of the world. Unfortunately, in the aftermath of the political and social turmoil in East Asia during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, all four cultures abandoned their use of literary Sinitic. As a result, a great many documents written in this important script have been ignored, leaving a substantial gap in our understanding of the relationship between the histories and cultures of premodern East Asia. Like its companion volume, Rethinking the Sinosphere: Poetics, Aesthetics and Identity Formation, this book seeks to fill this gap. One of the primary goals of this study is to break down the intellectual and cultural barriers that have made the Sinosphere difficult to see for itself. These barriers are of two sorts. One is the academic tendency toward intense specialization; most scholars of East Asia focus on a single country, a well-defined period, and an equally well-defined discipline (linguistics, philosophy, history, literature, art, etc.). Another is the tendency of scholars to privilege the country and period they study, and to adhere closely to their disciplinary training and outlook. To break down these barriers, a group of highly accomplished scholars committed to cross-cultural comparisons and interdisciplinary perspectives have been selected for this volume, and the result is a careful and critical examination of the complex cultural interactions that took place in premodern East Asia. Among the many contributions of this study are its examination of different literary genres (including "classics," poetic primers, works for and about women, detective stories, and folksongs), its broad chronological scope (from the eleventh to the twentieth centuries), its equally extensive spatial range (including China, the Xi Xia Kingdom, Japan, Vietnam, and Korea), and its attention to "minority" cultures. Another distinctive feature of this volume is its exploration of epistemological and culture change in late-nineteenth- and early twentieth-century East Asia Reexamining the Sinosphere: Transmissions and Transformations in East Asia will appeal not only to academic specialists in the histories, philosophies, literary and artistic traditions of East Asia, but also to instructors of college-level courses in East Asian history and culture"--},

Also known as ‘Golden Spice of India’ turmeric has been used in India for medicinal purposes for centuries. It has been used in traditional medicine as a household remedy for various diseases, including biliary disorders, anorexia, cough, diabetic wounds, hepatic disorders, rheumatism and sinusitis. In addition to its use as a spice and pigment, turmeric and its constituents mainly curcumin and essential oils shows a wide spectrum of biological actions. These include its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-carcinogenic, anti-mutagenic, anticoagulant, antifertility, anti-diabetic, antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal, antiviral, anti-fibrotic, anti-venom, antiulcer, hypotensive and hypocholesteremic activities. Modern interest on turmeric started in 1970's when researchers found that the herb may possess antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties. Safety evaluation studies indicate that both turmeric and curcumin are well tolerated at a very high dose without any toxic effects. Thus, turmeric and its constituents have the potential for the development of modern medicine for the treatment of various diseases.},

  abstract = {Eating is dangerous. While food contains nutrients and calories that animals need to produce heat and energy, it may also contain harmful parasites, bacteria, or chemicals. To guide food selection, the senses of taste and smell have evolved to alert us to the bitter taste of poisons and the sour taste and off-putting smell of spoiled foods. These sensory systems help people and animals to eat defensively, and they provide the brake that helps them avoid ingesting foods that are harmful. But choices about which foods to eat are motivated by more than avoiding the bad; they are also motivated by seeking the good, such as fat and sugar. However, just as not everyone is equally capable of sensing toxins in food, not everyone is equally enthusiastic about consuming high-fat, high-sugar foods. Genetic studies in humans and experimental animals strongly suggest that the liking of sugar and fat is influenced by genotype; likewise, the abilities to detect bitterness and the malodors of rotting food are highly variable among individuals. Understanding the exact genes and genetic differences that affect food intake may provide important clues in obesity treatment by allowing caregivers to tailor dietary recommendations to the chemosensory landscape of each person.},

  abstract = {The Youyang zazu is a ninth century miscellany by Duan Chengshi (c. 800-860) It is a collection of anecdotes, tales, lists and bits of information in which we read of historical people and events, supernatural creatures and events, and the various ways that the realm of the supernatural interacts with that of humans. Chapter one is a brief introduction of Youyang zazu. The first part is a general introduction, and the second part is a discussion of the value of the work. The third part of this chapter is a description of the dissertation project. Chapter two is a study of the textual history of Youyang zazu, and a biographical sketch of Duan Chengshi. Chapter three is a study of the content and the formal characteristics of the Youyang zazu. The work is shown to focus on the three primary themes of everyday life, things foreign and the supernatural. The Youyang zazu is shown in this chapter to be made up of four major types of literature. They are the list, the informative piece, the anecdote and the polished anecdote, or tale. Chapter four of the dissertation consists of fully annotated translations of a selection of one-hundred forty-five entries drawn from the collection. The translations are grouped on the basis of formal characteristics. Chapter five is a study and analysis of two of the juan (chapters) of the Youyang zazu. The first part of the chapter focuses on the unusual name shared by these juan and the second part is an analysis of their content, themes and formal characteristics. Chapter six is a fully annotated translation of juan fourteen and fifteen, the two "Nuogao ji." Chapter seven is a discussion of traditional and modern bibliographical treatment of this work. It is shown that not one of the generic labels associated with the Youyang zazu is appropriate as they are defined too narrowly to fit a work as diverse as the Youyang zazu. The second part of this chapter is a discussion of authorial intent.},

  abstract = {Manila was designated by Spain as the colonial capital of the Philippine archipelago in 1571. From being a small Muslim settlement, the city was swiftly transformed by the trans-Pacific galleon trade to Acapulco. Manila emerged as one of the greatest and wealthiest entrepoˆts in Southeast Asia, rivaling the Dutch city of Batavia in Indonesia and dominating commerce with America and Europe in both silk and spices. Manila became a magnet to trading ships from China, Japan, Maluku, Malacca, Siam, Cambodia, and Borneo, which arrived laden with an astonishing abundance of luxurious goods. The trade flows of silver and precious Asian merchandise—the bales of Chinese silks, the porcelain, Indian textiles, spices, local wax, honey, and forest products—and the shifting and hybrid populations that supplied labor and diverse expertise lent the city its own special character and texture.},

As a community of ethnic Tibetans in Nepal, crossing the border has slowly resulted in a shift of focus towards Kathmandu in many ways. Changing attitudes and evolving social practices are resulting in a marked shift in language use in the younger generations. Superf icially, the Nubri language appears quite vital within the valley. However, I show how an examination of different borders in the sociolinguistic landscape helps leads us to a much clearer understanding of the actual linguistic vitality, revealing a serious threat to its continued survival.},

While philosophical in its orientation, the book covers a wide body of literature across science and technology studies, media studies, digital humanities, digital sociology, cognitive science, and the study of artificial intelligence. In the first part of the book, the author formulates an epistemological thesis according to which the "virtual never ended." Although the frontiers between the real and the virtual are certainly more porous today, they still exist and endure. In the book's second part, the author offers an ontological reflection on emerging digital technologies as "imaginative machines." He introduces the concept of emagination, arguing that human schematizations are always externalized into technologies, and that human imagination has its analog in the digital dynamics of articulation between databases and algorithms. The author takes an ethical and political stance in the concluding chapter. He resorts to the notion of "digital habitus" for claiming that within the digital we are repeatedly being reconducted to an oversimplified image and understanding of ourselves. Digital Hermeneutics will be of interest to scholars across a wide range of disciplines, including those working on philosophy of technology, hermeneutics, science and technology studies, media studies, and the digital humanities"--},

  abstract = {[Jan Huygen van Linschoten's 1596 "Itinerario", published in Amsterdam just before Dutch world hegemony, opened the Indian Ocean world for the European geographical imagination, especially regarding its spice markets and non-Christian cultures. Linschoten confirmed rumors in Europe that the Portuguese Estado da Índia had become decadent and unstable, especially in its capital Goa. He also mentioned the absence of Portuguese control in the market of Bantam, which would become the capital of Dutch Indonesia. In addition, the book disclosed nautical and economic information about the Indian Ocean until then carefully guarded by the Portuguese, especially about the Spice Islands. In fact, the book's navigational section was published early so it could be on board the so-called First Voyage organized by the Dutch. This article discusses the main features that made the cartographic, cultural, and economic information of the "Itinerario" crucial to this historical expedition. Historicizing the discipline of geography is indispensable for understanding how travel and technology affect what can be known of the planet. Following Foucault's understanding of the production of knowledge, the central argument is that the "Itinerario" inaugurated a leap in the Dutch geographical "episteme" and a new struggle for the Indian Ocean. Linschoten's humanist scholarship was from the start a multiplicity of knowledges and voices that could be read and used in many ways. ᖖ年，在荷兰建立世界霸权之前，林斯豪滕（ Jan Huygen van Linschoten ）的航海旅行记在阿姆斯特丹出版，该书向欧洲的地理界开启了印度洋世界，特别是有关香料市场和非基督教文化的部分。林斯豪滕证实了在欧洲的传言，即葡萄牙的埃斯塔达印度已经变得腐朽和不稳定，尤其在其首都果阿。他还提到了葡萄牙对万丹市场的缺乏控制，该地区后来成了荷属印度尼西亚的首都。此外，书中还披露了有关印度洋的航海和经济信息，在此之前，这些信息一直被葡萄牙人小心地守护着，尤其是关于香料群岛的信息。事实上，本书的航海章节是提前出版的，为的是赶上由荷兰组织的所谓首航。本文讨论了该航海旅行记在制图学，文化和经济信息方面的主要特点，这些信息对这次历史性的探险是至关重要的。为了理解旅行和技术是如何影响我们认识所在的星球，对地理学科的历史化了解是必不可少的。基于福柯的关于知识产生的认识，本文的中心论点是，林斯豪滕的航海旅行记开创了荷兰地理“知识”的飞跃，并且开启了新一轮对印度洋的争斗。林斯豪滕的人文主义奖学金从一开始就是一个知识和观点的多重体，可以在多方面加以解读和使用。 El "Itinerario" de JanHuygen van Linschoten de 1596, publicado en Amsterdam poco antes de la hegemonía holandesa global, abrió el mundo del Océano Índico a la imaginación geográfica de los europeos, en especial lo tocante a sus mercados de especias y culturas no cristianas. Linschoten confirmó los rumores que circulaban en Europa de que el Estado da Índia portugués se había tornado decadente e inestable, especialmente su capital Goa. Él también mencionó la ausencia de control portgugués sobre el mercado de Bantam, que llegaría a ser la capital de la Indonesia holandesa. Además, el libro reveló información náutica y económica sobre el Océano Índico, hasta entonces cuidadosamente ocultada por los portugueses, en particular la relacionada con las Islas de la Especiería. En efecto, la sección del libro sobre navegación se publicó primero, de suerte que pudiese estar a bordo del llamado Primer Viaje organizado por los holandeses. En este artículo se discuten los rasgos principales que convirtieron en crucial la información carográfica, cultural y económica del "Itinerario" para esta histórica expedición. Historiar la disciplina geográfica es indispensable para entender cómo el viaje y la ecnología afectan lo que se pueda conocer del planeta. Siguiendo el pensamiento de Foucault sobre la producción de conocimiento, el argumento central que se presenta aquí es que el "Itinerario" inauguró un salto en el "episteme" geográfico holandés y una nueva contienda por el Océano Índico. Desde el principio la erudición humanista de Linschoten fue una multiplicidad de conocimientos y voces que podrían interpretarse y utilizarse de muchas maneras.]},

Against the common perception of a city founded 762 in a vacuum, which, after experiencing a heyday in a mythical "golden age" under the early Abbasids, entered since 900 a long period of decline that ended with a complete collapse by savage people from the East in 1258, the volume emphasizes the continuity of Baghdad's urban life, and shows how it was marked by its destiny as caliphal seat and cultural hub.

  abstract = {"This is the first genuine etymological dictionary of Old Chinese written in any language. As such, it constitutes a milestone in research on the evolution of the Sinitic language group. Whereas previous studies have emphasized the structure of the Chinese characters, this pathbreaking dictionary places primary emphasis on the sounds and meanings of Sinitic roots. Based on more than three decades of intensive investigation in primary and secondary sources, this completely new dictionary places Old Chinese squarely within the Sino-Tibetan language family (including close consideration of numerous Tiberto-Burman languages), while paying due regard to other language families such as Austroasiatic, Miao-Yao (Hmong-Mien), and Kam-Tai." "Designed for use by nonspecialists and specialists alike, the dictionary is highly accessible, being arranged in alphabetical order and possessed of numerous innovative lexicographical features. Each entry offers one or more possible etymologies as well as reconstructed pronunciations and other relevant data. Words that are morphologically related are grouped together into "word families" that attempt to make explicit the derivational or other etymological processes that relate them. The dictionary is preceded by a substantive and significant introduction that outlines the author's views on the linguistic position of Chinese within Asia and details the phonological and morphological properties, to the degree they are known, of the earliest stages of the Chinese language and its ancestor. This introduction, because it both summaries and synthesizes earlier work and makes several original contributions, functions as a useful reference work all on its own."–Jacket.},

The front section contains anentry for every flavour match listed in the back section and isorganised into 16 flavour themes such a Bramble \& Hedge, Green \& Grassy, and Earthy. There are 980 entries in all, with 200 recipes and suggestions embedded in the text. It covers classic pairings such as pork \& apple, lamb \& apricot, and cucumber \& dill; contemporary favourites likechocolate \& chilli, and goat's cheese \& beetroot; and interesting but unlikely-sounding couples including blackpudding \& chocolate, lemon \& beef, blueberry \& mushroom, and watermelon \& oyster. Beautifully packaged, The Flavour Thesaurus is not only a highlyuseful, and covetable, reference book that will immeasurably improveyour cooking - it's the sort of book that might keep you up at nightreading."},

This new phase was triggered by the formation of Chinese maritime networks to southern Asia. While the Song period witnessed the formation of private trade and shipping networks, the aggressive foreign policy of the Yuan court led to the establishment of a government maritime network. The maritime networking to southern Asia culminated in the increased numbers of Ming emissaries, including the fleets of the admiral Zheng He, who visited Indian ports in the fifteenth century and intervened in the diplomatic affairs of several strategic Indian commerical zones. /// La période qui s'étend du treizième jusqu'au milieu du quinzième siècles présente une phase distincte et importante des relations indo-chinoises. Cette nouvelle phase résulta de la création des réseaux maritimes chinois vers l'Asie du Sud. La période Song est marquée par la formation d'un commerce privatisé et des réseaux maritimes; or, l'agressive politique extérieure de la dynastie Yuan eut comme conséquence la création d'un réseau maritime officiel.

  abstract = {The maritime regions of Southeast Asia played an important but varying role in connecting South Asia and China prior to the sixteenth century. With regard to commercial exchanges, traders, ships, and polities in Southeast Asia facilitated and sometimes controlled the flow of goods. Additionally, merchant associations from South Asia and China established their bases in Southeast Asia to participate in trading activities in the Bay of Bengal and South China Sea regions. At least three distinct networks emerged as a result of these maritime interactions: 1) networks of exchanges among the polities skirting the Bay of Bengal; 2) networks that connected the areas around the South China Sea; and 3) networks of direct exchanges between South Asia and China. Buddhist ideas also circulated through these networks, but seem to have made limited inroads in the maritime regions of Southeast Asia prior to the fifth century AD. By this time, Buddhism had already spread widely in China, with significant number of Buddhist missionaries arriving in the region through the maritime routes. Rather than playing a staging role in the transmission of Buddhism to China, the doctrine may have penetrated maritime Southeast Asia due to the vibrant Buddhist interactions and a significant increase in commercial activity along the networks linking South Asia and China during the fourth and fifth centuries. The use of Buddhism to legitimise new regimes in China and the diplomatic exchanges between Southeast Asian polities and these courts may have also facilitated the spread of Buddhism in the region.},

The essay analyzes Zheng He’s intervention in the dispute between Calicut and Cochin, the armed conflict in Sri Lanka in 1410-11, and the expedition’s involvement in a dispute between Bengal and its neighboring polity, Jaunpur. These episodes in South Asia make it difficult to accept the modern representations of the Zheng He expeditions as diplomatic missions intended to promote peace and harmony. Rather, they were, as the essay contends, part of the Yongle emperor’s aim to establish hegemony over “all the known world under the Heaven” or the tianxia.},

The pursuit of this wizened berry with the bite changed history in ways you've never dreamed, involving extraordinary voyages, international trade, exotic locales, exploitation, brutality, disease, extinctions, and rebellions, and featuring a set of remarkable characters.' From the abundance of wildlife on the islands of the Indian Ocean, which the Europeans used as stepping stones to India and the East Indies, to colorful accounts of the sultan of Banda Aceh entertaining his European visitors with great banquets and elephant fights, this fascinating book reveals the often surprising story behind one of mankind's most common spices"–},

  abstract = {Tasting Difference examines early modern discourses of racial, cultural, and religious difference that emerged in the wake of contact with foreign peoples and foreign foods from across the globe. Gitanjali Shahani reimagines the contact zone between Western Europe and the global South in culinary terms, emphasizing the gut rather than the gaze in colonial encounters. From household manuals that instructed English housewives how to use newly imported foodstuffs to "the spicèd Indian air" of A Midsummer Night's Dream, from the repurposing of Othello as an early modern pitchman for coffee in ballads to the performance of disgust in travel narratives, Shahani shows how early modern genres negotiated the allure and danger of foreign tastes. Turning maxims such as "We are what we eat" on their head, Shahani asks how did{$<$}em{$>$}we{$<$}/em{$>$} (the colonized subjects) become what you (the colonizing subjects) eat? How did we become alternately the object of fear and appetite, loathing and craving? Shahani takes us back several centuries to the process by which food came to be inscribed with racial character and the racial other came to be marked as edible, showing how the racializing of food began in an era well before chicken tikka masala and Balti cuisine. Bringing into conversation critical paradigms in early modern studies, food studies, and postcolonial studies, she argues that it is in the writing on food and eating that we see among the earliest configurations of racial difference, and it is experienced both as a different taste and as a taste of difference.},

  abstract = {Food and nutrition have not only been contributed by biological production through its cultivation and husbandry, it reflects the history and tradition of a nation as well. India has historically been one of the world’s prominent sites for the origin and husbandry of a good score of spices which transcends history nation and culture since time immemorial. The suitability of ecological configuration and meteorological behaviour, the Indian diaspora have carried it forward not only to support her cultural tradition but also to meet up both therapeutic and culinary requirements of spices. From mythology to history, from history to the modern political economy, spices have got a beautiful and aromatic continuity across nations and cultures. The quality of food and its palatability, the nutritive value of food and its therapeutics are nicely contributed by spices. The geospatial distribution in India encompasses hill terrains to rain forest, coastal ecosystem to semi-arid agro-ecology, moist forest ecosystem to rice-based agro-ecosystem in alluvial lands. Spices have got a well-pervading role for integrating ecological diversity and cultural mellifluence. This chapter is designed to keep on unveiling the following aspects of spices in India: history, literature, geospatial distribution over India, the cultural aroma and its socio-economic uniqueness for supporting macro-economy as well as community livelihood generation process.},

  abstract = {Synaesthesia (e.g. 'sweet silence') consists of the mapping of properties from one modality to another. The present article introduces a cognitive account regarding the directionality of the mapping in poetic discourse. Firstly, we suggest that mapping from lower modalities onto higher ones (e.g. from 'touch' onto 'sight') is more frequently used in poetic discourse than the opposite mapping (i.e. from higher to lower modalities). The findings of a textual analysis of a large-scale poetic corpus are introduced, which support this proposal, and reveal that the 'low to high' mapping is more frequently used than its inverse, and that this tendency is a universal one (across national boundaries and historical periods).Secondly, we propose a cognitive account for this universal tendency according to which the 'low to high' mapping conforms to (while its inverse violates) the following cognitive constraint: mapping from a more accessible concept onto a less accessible one is more natural than its inverse. The findings of an interpretation experiment are introduced, which provide some support for this account by suggesting that the more frequently used structure (i.e. the mapping from the more accessible to the less accessible sense) is easier to comprehend than its inverse.We conclude by proposing that aspects of poetic language are themselves constrained by general cognitive constraints.},

  abstract = {Over the millennia after the Eastern Han Dynasty, the introduction of Buddhism into China and the translation of Buddhist scriptures resulted in intense language contact between Sanskrit and Chinese, which have greatly influenced the Chinese language in three ways. First, an unprecedentedly large number of loanwords derived from Sanskrit were borrowed into the Chinese language. They were employed not only in religious contexts but also in the daily language of the common people. Second, new linguistic structures emerged in the course of translating Sanskrit texts into Chinese. This produced a long-lasting effect on the evolution of the Chinese grammar and the formation of Early Modern Chinese. Third, the study of Sanskrit promoted the study of Chinese phonology; most prominently, siddham led to the emergence of dengyunxue等韵学, and the systematic research of Chinese initials, finals and tones.},

Knowledge, embodied in various people, materials, texts, objects, and practices, also moved and came together along these routes in hubs of exchange where different social and cultural groups intersected and interacted. {$<$}em{$>$}Entangled Itineraries{$<$}/em{$>$} traces this movement of knowledge across the Eurasian continent from the early years of the Common Era to the nineteenth century, following local goods, techniques, tools, and writings as they traveled and transformed into new material and intellectual objects and ways of knowing. Focusing on nonlinear trajectories of knowledge in motion, this volume follows itineraries that weaved in and out of busy, crowded cosmopolitan cities in China; in the trade hubs of Kucha and Malacca; and in centers of Arabic scholarship, such as Reyy and Baghdad, which resonated in Bursa, Assam, and even as far as southern France. Contributors explore the many ways in which materials, practices, and knowledge systems were transformed and codified as they converged, swelled, at times disappeared, and often reemerged anew.},

The story begins with the aromatic juniper berry originally used by the Dutch to flavour the whisky-like genever. The drink then made its way to Britain, where cheap imitations laced with turpentine and other caustic fillers made it the drink of choice for poor eighteenth-century Londoners. Eventually replaced by the sweetened Old Tom style and then by London Dry, gin was introduced to the wider world by means of the British Empire, and during the Jazz Age became a mainstay of a new drinking culture: the cocktail. Today classic cocktails like the Gimlet and the Negroni are embraced by drinkers who enjoy a new breed of modern gins, and gin has reclaimed pride of place in the world of mixology. Gin: A Global History will attract both cocktail aficionados and lovers of food history as it chronicles gin's evolution from cheap liquor to modern alcoholic marvel."--Publisher description},

It is native to Iran and Afghanistan. Its dried latex (gum oleoresin) is generally used for flavouring curries, sauces, and pickles. Therapeutically, it stimulates the intestinal and respiratory tracts as well as the nervous system. It is beneficial in asthma, whooping cough, and chronic bronchitis. Its essential oil is also used in medicines, food and cosmetic industries. Besides, it is also used as an alternative for pesticides in organic farming. The major constituents of asafoetida are the resin (40–64\%), gum (25\%) and essential oil (10–17\%). The butyl propenyl disulphide is responsible for the aroma of asafoetida. The asaresinotannol is the major constituent present in the resin. It can be grown on unproductive cold deserts of dry temperate areas of Himalayas. It is mainly propagated by seeds. The seeds are sown either in winters or spring. It becomes ready for harvesting after 5 years of planting and yields around 900g per plant. The oleo gum resin and essential oil derived from this plant are sold at premium prices in the international market. The small and marginal farmers of Kinnaur, Lahaul-Spiti and Chamba can benefit from this new emerging crop.},

What does, however, travel everywhere is the appetite for the special substance tellurium. A spike of tellurium, driven into the brain by an expert hand, offers a transforming experience of bliss; incorrectly administered, it means death. The fifty chapters of Telluria map out this brave new world from fifty different angles, as Sorokin, always a virtuoso of the word, introduces us, among many other figures, to partisans and princes, peasants and party leaders, a new Knights Templar, a harem of phalluses, and a dog-headed poet and philosopher who feasts on carrion from the battlefield. The book is a immense and sumptuous tapestry of the word, carnivalesuqe and cruel, and Max Lawton, Sorokin's gifted translator, has captured it in an English that carries the charge of Cormac McCarthy and William Gibson"--},

  abstract = {Black pepper (Piper nigrum) is one of the most widely used among spices. It is valued for its distinct biting quality attributed to the alkaloid, piperine. Black pepper is used not only in human dietaries but also for a variety of other purposes such as medicinal, as a preservative, and in perfumery. Many physiological effects of black pepper, its extracts, or its major active principle, piperine, have been reported in recent decades. Dietary piperine, by favorably stimulating the digestive enzymes of pancreas, enhances the digestive capacity and significantly reduces the gastrointestinal food transit time. Piperine has been demonstrated in in vitro studies to protect against oxidative damage by inhibiting or quenching free radicals and reactive oxygen species. Black pepper or piperine treatment has also been evidenced to lower lipid peroxidation in vivo and beneficially influence cellular thiol status, antioxidant molecules and antioxidant enzymes in a number of experimental situations of oxidative stress. The most far-reaching attribute of piperine has been its inhibitory influence on enzymatic drug biotransforming reactions in the liver. It strongly inhibits hepatic and intestinal aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and UDP-glucuronyl transferase. Piperine has been documented to enhance the bioavailability of a number of therapeutic drugs as well as phytochemicals by this very property. Piperine’s bioavailability enhancing property is also partly attributed to increased absorption as a result of its effect on the ultrastructure of intestinal brush border. Although initially there were a few controversial reports regarding its safety as a food additive, such evidence has been questionable, and later studies have established the safety of black pepper or its active principle, piperine, in several animal studies. Piperine, while it is non-genotoxic, has in fact been found to possess anti-mutagenic and anti-tumor influences.},

  abstract = {What would medieval English literature look like if we viewed it through the lens of the compendium? In that case, Chaucer’s contemporary, John Trevisa, might come into focus as the major author of the fourteenth century. Trevisa (d. 1402) made a career of translating big informational Latin texts into English prose, supported by the patronage of the baron Thomas de Berkeley (1352–1417). These included Ranulph Higden’s               Polychronicon,               an enormous universal history with continuations to the present; Bartholomaeus Anglicus’s well-known natural encyclopedia               De proprietatibus rerum               ; and Giles of Rome’s beloved advice-for-princes manual,               De regimine principum.               These were shrewd choices, accessible and on trend:               De proprietatibus rerum               and               De regimine principum               had already been translated into French and copied in deluxe manuscripts for the French and English nobility, and the               Polychronicon               had been circulating England for several decades. This book argues that John Trevisa’s translations of compendious texts disclose an alternative literary history by way of medieval information culture. Modern readers typically encounter medieval English literature through Trevisa’s contemporaries, Chaucer, Gower, and Langland, a triumvirate representing a range of literary styles and languages formative to English letters. How might the nature of this encounter change if Trevisa was in the mix? Can big informational genres give us a purchase on medieval English poetry and prose? And how might Trevisa’s oeuvre enable us to envision a new literary history rooted in the compilation and translation of compendious information alongside texts traditionally labeled as literary?},

  abstract = {Being able to talk about what humans perceive with their senses is one of the fundamental capacities of language. But how do languages encode perceptual information? In this paper, we analyze how experiences from different senses (sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell) are encoded differentially across lexical categories (nouns, verbs, adjectives) in the English language. Three independently collected lists of perception-related words show that sound concepts are more prone to being expressed as verbs. Additional data show that nouns rated to strongly relate to motion are also rated to strongly relate to sound, more so than is the case for color-related nouns. We argue that the association of sound with verbs is due to sound concepts being inherently more dynamic, motion-related and event-based, in contrast to other sensory perceptions which are phenomenologically less strongly associated with motion and change. Overall, our results are the first to show differential encoding of perception-related concepts across different lexical categories. Our analyses of lexical patterns furthermore provide empirical evidence for the interconnection between semantics and grammar.},

  abstract = {In the existing literature on synaesthetic metaphors in poetry it is proposed that transfers tend to go from the ‘lower’ (touch, smell, taste) to the ‘higher’ (sight, hearing) sensory modalities. The purpose of this article is to establish if the same directionality also holds for synaesthetic associations found in other text types. To this end, a method for the semi-automatic extraction of synaesthesia is introduced and applied to general-purpose corpora of English (ukWaC) and Italian (itWaC). In the data collected for these languages, most transfers proceed in the expected direction, e.g.               sweet voice               , but instances of ‘backward’ transfers are also found, e.g.               bitter cold               . Based on these results, it is claimed that the ‘directionality principle’ reflects the               frequency               of association types, rather than representing universal constraints on synaesthetic transfers, as has often been more or less explicitly assumed. It is here argued that both properties of human perception and more strictly linguistic factors can account for the frequency tendencies observed in synaesthesia. The proposed interpretation is also shown to account for apparently contradictory evidence coming from typological studies on verbs of perception.},

While great progress has been made with the construction of ever more comprehensive database systems and archives, far more remains not only possible but also realistically achievable in the near future. This paper discusses some of the key challenges faced, and progress made towards solving them, in the context of a widely used open digital platform attempting to expand the range of digitized sources available while simultaneously increasing the scope of meaningful tasks that can be performed with them computationally. This paper aims to suggest how seemingly simple human-mediated additions to the digitized historical record – when combined with the power of digital systems to repeatedly perform mechanical tasks at enormous scales – quickly lead to transformative changes in the feasible scope of computational analysis of premodern writing.},

  abstract = {Ancient incens vocabulary is part of ancient Chinese vocabulary，This article uses a combination of synchronic and diachronic,description and interpretation,and literature and physical research to study the ancient incense vocabulary. The chapter one sorts and classifies incense vocabulary in ancient documents and classics and focuses on the four types of vocabulary of incense names,incense words,incense actions and other incense words.Describe and analyze the meaning of important words in each type of vocabulary. The chapter two studies the formation and development of incense vocabulary. Incense vocabulary is mainly generated by absorbing the common language components of the whole people,creating new words and foreign words.Absorbing the common language components of the whole people includes borrowing in general,transformation borrowing,metaphorical borrowing,and transfer borrowing.The emergence and development of incense has led to the emergence of new words. Explore the four situations of the enlargement,reduction,transfer and extinction of the meaning of incense words.The foreign words play an important role in the evolution of incense vocabulary.The foreign words in the incense vocabulary are examined and demonstrated and the characteristics of the foreign words are analyzed. The chapter three discusses the word formation of incense words from the perspective of morphemes.There are simple words and compound words.The simple words of incense vocabulary include reduplicated words and conjunctions.Compound words are the main way of word formation in Xiangshi vocabulary.It mainly studies four ways of word formation, which are combination,subject predicate, verb object and partial formal. The chapter four studies the phenomenon of incongruity words with the same name and different names,and analyzes the causes of these two phenomena.There are a lot of synonyms with similar names in the incense vocabulary.The naming justifications for such words include color factors,morphological factors,trait factors,origin factors,modification factors,rhetoric factors,space-time factors,elegant factors and social factors；There are words with the same name in the incense vocabulary.The naming justifications for this type of vocabulary include color factor,shape factor,shape factor,texture factor,beautification factor,and generic factor.},

  abstract = {Automatically building semantic resources is essential to low resource-languages like Uyghur. However, Uyghur suffers from a lack of publicly available evaluation dataset for automatically building semantic resources like WordNet. To cope with this problem, first, we build the largest Uyghur-English and English-Uyghur dictionaries by exploiting many possible online and offline resources. Then by using Princeton WordNet (PWN)3.0 and Contemporary Uyghur Detailed Dictionary (CUDD), we construct an English-Uyghur WordNet evaluation dataset which is publicly available (https://github.com/kaharjan/uywordnet). In this dataset, more than 73,000 English synsets are mapped Uyghur automatically, in which over 20,000 are annotated manually. And the corresponding Uyghur words include definition and examples in Uyghur language context. We also propose a Synset Mapping based on Word Embeddings(SMWE) method. The experimental results on the dataset are promising.},

Sutton places the fig in its historical context, examining its peculiar origins and the importance it has garnered in so many countries. Sutton begins by describing the fig's strange biology-botanically, it is not a fruit, but rather a cluster of ingrowing flowers-th.},

  abstract = {The natural resources of New Guinea and nearby islands have attracted outsiders for at least 5000 years: spices, aromatic woods and barks, resins, plumes, sea slugs, shells and pearls all brought traders from distant markets. Among the most sought-after was the bird of paradise. Their magnificent plumes bedecked the hats of fashion-conscious women in Europe and America, provided regalia for the Kings of Nepal, and decorated the headdresses of Janissaries of the Ottoman Empire. Plumes from Paradise tells the story of this interaction, and of the economic, political, social and cultural consequence for the island's inhabitants. It traces 400 years of economic and political history, culminating in the 'plume boom' of the early part of the 20th century, when an unprecedented number of outsiders flocked to the island's coasts and hinterlands. The story teems with the variety of people involved: New Guineans, Indonesians, Chinese, Europeans, hunters, traders, natural historians and their collectors, officials, missionaries, planters, miners, adventurers of every kind. In the wings were the conservationists, whose efforts brought the slaughter of the plume boom to an end and ushered in an era of comparative isolation for the island that lasted until World War II.},

  abstract = {While eating is a universal experience, for Singaporeans it carries strong national connotations. The popular Singaporean–English phrase “Die die must try” is not so much hyperbole as it is a reflection of the lengths that Singaporeans will go to find great dishes. This book argues that in a society that has undergone substantial change in a relatively short amount of time, food serves Singaporeans as a poignant connection to the past. Covering the period from British settlement in 1819 to the present and focusing on the post-1965 postcolonial era, the book tells the story of Singapore through the production and consumption of food. Analyzing a variety of sources that range from cookbooks to architectural and city plans, the book offers a thematic history of this unusual country, which was colonized by the British and operated as a port within Malaya, but which is without a substantial pre-colonial history. Connecting food culture to the larger history of Singapore, the book discusses various topics including domesticity and home economics, housing and architecture, advertising, and the regulation of food-related manners and public behavior such as hawking, littering, and chewing gum. Moving away from the predominantly political and economic focus of other histories of Singapore, the book provides an important alternative reading of Singaporean society.},

  abstract = {The Penn Museum has a long and storied history of research and archaeological exploration in the ancient Middle East. This book highlights this rich depth of knowledge while also serving as a companion volume to the Museum's signature Middle East Galleries opening in April 2018. This edited volume includes chapters and integrated short, focused pieces from Museum curators and staff actively involved in the detailed planning of the new galleries. In addition to highlighting the most remarkable and interesting objects in the Museum's extraordinary Middle East collections, this volume illuminates the primary themes within these galleries (make, settle, connect, organize, and believe) and provides a larger context within which to understand them. The ancient Middle East is home to the first urban settlements in human history, dating to the fourth millennium BCE; therefore, tracing this move toward city life figures prominently in the book. The topic of urbanization, how it came about and how these early steps still impact our daily lives, is explored from regional and localized perspectives, bringing us from Mesopotamia (Ur, Uruk, and Nippur) to Islamic and Persianate cites (Rayy and Isfahan) and, finally, connecting back to life in modern Philadelphia. Through examination of topics such as landscape, resources, trade, religious belief and burial practices, daily life, and nomads, this very important human journey is investigated both broadly and with specific case studies.},

  abstract = {European Orientalism of the 19th and 20th centuries has been the subject of a heated and vigorous debate ever since the publication of Edward Said's monograph. By contrast, the study of the early stages of academic and cultural Orientalism has been neglected. For the beginnings of Oriental studies in Europe one still largely relies on institutional histories and archival research, or even V. V. Barthold's 80-year-old study. The birth of academic Orientalism in the 17th century was occasioned by three major factors: a renewed interest in Islam, major advances in travel and exploration, and the emergence of modern approaches to science and education. Among important background developments were the decline of the perceived Arab threat followed by the rise of a very real Ottoman Turkish one, the geographical shift in hostilities from the European West to the East, and the realignment of European alliances and attitudes in the wake of the Protestant Reformation.},

More than 100 loan words are scritinized and classified in eight sections, according to their origin: Old Iranian (probably issued from the common ancestry of the ‘Sakan’ languages, Khotanese, Tumshuqese and Waxi), three different stages of Khotanese, ‘Śaka’, (the language of the Iranian invaders of northern India), Parthian, Bactrian and Sogdian. Tocharians had dealings with all neighbouring Iranian peoples, but Khotanese and its ancestors clearly exerted the most durable influence. No loan word from more remote dialects (e.g. Persian and Ossetic) can be evidenced. The predominance of war-related and political vocabulary among the loan words and the direction of borrowing, overwhelmingly from Iranian to Tocharian, both point to a political ascendancy of Sakan-speaking tribes, and later of Bactria, on Tocharians.},

Each paper is fully updated for this volume, and includes linking commentaries and summaries, for easy cross-reference.

Due to its known antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, it has long been used in various areas, such as cosmetology, medicine, and pharmacology. However, high concentrations can be toxic. A dose of 2.5 mg/kg body weight is regarded as safe. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge regarding the activities and application of eugenol and its derivatives and recent research of these compounds. This review is based on information concerning eugenol characteristics and recent research from articles in PubMed. Eugenol remains of great interest to researchers, since its multidirectional action allows it to be a potential component of drugs and other products with therapeutic potential against a range of diseases.},

  abstract = {How did Arabic loanwords end up in Indonesian? Various academic answers to this intriguing question have been put forward, but only rarely has any solid linguistic 'proof' been provided. General conclusions have been drawn on the basis of a few, rather unrepresentative or obsolete, examples. Academics have copied arguments and hypotheses from one another, without any independent research into their reliability. Some of the arguments, or pure hypotheses, have obtained the status of pseudo 'established fact', irrespective of the fact that they lack academic justification. This article makes an effort to put the record straight by showing that a Persian or Persianized connection cannot be proven statistically, as claimed by Stuart Campbell. It also shows that some loanwords have a colloquial, occasionaly even regionally identifiable Arabic origin, but that the claim by Versteegh and others of a South Arabian or Hadrami connection cannot be convincingly established. It finally demonstrates that more attention should be given to the linguistic particularities of the recipient (Indonesian/Nusantara) language, than to concentrate mainly on the characteristics of the Arabic language which provided these loanwords. Unknown Arabic phonemes deserve special attention because they were in some cases interpreted and adopted by Indonesian/Nusantara listeners as phonemes that were phonetically nearest to these, and which were part of their own phoneme system.},

  abstract = {Background In the current healthcare environment, an alarming rise in multi-drug resistant bacterial infections has led to a global health threat. The lack of new antibiotics has created a need for developing alternative strategies. Objective Understanding the antibacterial mechanisms of cinnamon and its constituents is crucial to enhance it as a potential new source of antibiotic. The objective of this review is to provide a compilation of all described mechanisms of antibacterial action of cinnamon and its constituents and synergism with commercial antibiotics in order to better understand how cinnamon and its constituents can collaborate as alternative treatment to multi-drug resistant bacterial infections. Methods The relevant references on antibacterial activities of cinnamon and its constituents were searched. Meanwhile, the references were classified according to the type of mechanism of action against bacteria. Relationships of cinnamon or its constituents and antibiotics were also analyzed and summarized. Results Cinnamon extracts, essential oils, and their compounds have been reported to inhibit bacteria by damaging cell membrane; altering the lipid profile; inhibiting ATPases, cell division, membrane porins, motility, and biofilm formation; and via anti-quorum sensing effects. Conclusion This review describes the antibacterial effects of cinnamon and its constituents, such as cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid, against pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The review also provides an overview of the current knowledge of the primary modes of action of these compounds as well as the synergistic interactions between cinnamon or its constituents with known antibacterial agents. This information will be useful in improving the effectiveness of therapeutics based on these compounds.},

  abstract = {Culinary herbs and spices have been used as both food flavoring and food preservative agents for centuries. Moreover, due to their known and presumptive health benefits, herbs and spices have also been used in medical practices since ancient times. Some of the health effects attributed to herbs and spices include antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory effects as well as potential protection against cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. While interest in herbs and spices as medicinal agents remains high and their use in foods continues to grow, there have been remarkably few studies that have attempted to track the dietary intake of herbs and spices and even fewer that have tried to find potential biomarkers of food intake (BFIs). The aim of the present review is to systematically survey the global literature on herbs and spices in an effort to identify and evaluate specific intake biomarkers for a representative set of common herbs and spices in humans. A total of 25 herbs and spices were initially chosen, including anise, basil, black pepper, caraway, chili pepper, cinnamon, clove, cumin, curcumin, dill, fennel, fenugreek, ginger, lemongrass, marjoram, nutmeg, oregano, parsley, peppermint and spearmint, rosemary, saffron, sage, tarragon, and thyme. However, only 17 of these herbs and spices had published, peer-reviewed studies describing potential biomarkers of intake. In many studies, the herb or spice of interest was administrated in the form of a capsule or extract and very few studies were performed with actual foods. A systematic assessment of the candidate biomarkers was also performed. Given the limitations in the experimental designs for many of the published studies, further work is needed to better evaluate the identified set of BFIs. Although the daily intake of herbs and spices is very low compared to most other foods, this important set of food seasoning agents should not be underestimated, especially given their potential benefits to human health.},

Furthermore, we are eager to know what kind of interconnections can be found between the transformations and the responsibility felt for the place itself and its inhabitants. The newcomers’ impact on the basin is both symbolic and material. People moving into the villages of the Káli Basin not only played a substantial part in the production and popularization of the Káli Basin’s representation, but, in time, became significant actors of local economy.},

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty healthy normal-weight volunteers, 19 healthy overweight subjects, and 22 obese subjects were enrolled. For each subject, the lateralization Oldfield score, body weight, height, and blood pressure were determined. The taste test is based on filter paper strips soaked with 4 taste stimuli presented at different concentrations to evoke 4 basic taste qualities (salty, sour, sweet, and bitter); pure rapeseed oil and water were also administered to evoke fat and neutral taste qualities. The stimuli were applied to each side of the protruded tongue. Subjects were asked to identify the taste from a list of eight descriptions according to a multiple choice paradigm. RESULTS: The results showed a general lowering of taste sensitivity with the increase of BMI, except for the taste of fat with rapeseed oil as the stimulus. Other variables affecting taste sensitivity are age (negative association), gender (women generally show higher sensitivity), and taste stimuli concentration (positive association). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings could provide important insights into how new therapies could be designed for weight loss and long-term weight maintenance and how diets could be planned combining the correct caloric and nutritional supply with individual taste preferences.},

  abstract = {[One of the most influential ideas in Southeast Asian history in recent decades has been Anthony Reid's Age of Commerce thesis, which sees a commercial boom and the emergence of port cities as hubs of commerce over the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries, which in turn spurred political, social and economic changes throughout the region. But how new were the changes described in Reid's Age of Commerce? This paper argues that the four centuries from circa 900 to 1300 CE can be seen as an 'Early Age of Commerce' in Southeast Asia. During this period, a number of commercial and financial changes in China, South Asia, the Middle East and within the Southeast Asian region, greatly promoted maritime trade, which induced the emergence of new ports and urban centres, the movement of administrative capitals toward the coast, population expansion, increased maritime links between societies, the expansion of Theravada Buddhism and Islam, increased monetisation, new industries, new forms of consumption and new mercantile organisations. It is thus proposed that the period from 900 to 1300 be considered the Early Age of Commerce in Southeast Asian history.]},

The article describes this historic role and looks into its various uses in the following centuries until modernity. In the age of enlightenment, a comprehensive scientific literature was produced describing and studying the medicinal plant. As an example the dissertation of Christoph Göller from the year 1709 is outlined. Nine different cinnamon provenances from Ceylon are described there, and the different characteristics of the bark of each species portrayed. Göller recorded a long list of medical uses from cardiac to nervous treatments. Among the more modern uses, the application against diabetes is described quoting from a 2003 Pakistani study by Kahn et al.}

Born in fourteenth-century Morocco, and a contemporary of Marco Polo, Ibn Battuta has left us an account in his own words of his remarkable journeys throughout the Islamic world and beyond: journeys punctuated by adventure and peril, and stretching from his home in Tangier to Zaitun in faraway China.Whether sojourning in Delhi and the Maldives, wandering through the mazy streets of Cairo and Damascus, or contesting with pirates and shipwreck, the indefatigable Ibn Battuta brings to vivid life a medieval world brimming with marvel and mystery. Carefully observing the great diversity of civilizations that he encountered, Ibn Battuta exhibits an omnivorous interest in such matters as food and drink, religious differences (among Christians, Hindus and Shia Muslims), ideas about purity and impurity, disease, women and sex. Recounting the many miracles that its author claims to have experienced personally, his al-rihla or 'Travelogue' is a fascinating mosaic of mysticism and reportage offering a prototype magic realism. David Waines discusses the subtleties of the al-rihla, revealing all the wonders of Ibn Battuta's world to the modern reader. This is a gripping treatment of the life and times of one of history's most daring, and at the same time most human, discoverers.},

In this study, we cataloged the tree species in 191 temples across China. Then, we analyzed the species composition, geographical distribution pattern, and the impact factors of Buddhist tree species distribution in different regions to clarify the role of temples in biodiversity conservation. The results showed that: (1) From across 191 temples, we observed a total of 1,059 tree species, belonging to 116 families and 410 genera with most species (n = 773) occurred in only one or two temples. (2) Temple gardens were rich in native and threatened tree species (n = 94), and thus, are of high biodiversity conservation value. (3) The tree species composition of Buddhist temples in different climatic zones was quite different. (4) Tree species across temples had a distinct replacement phenomenon where original Buddhist tree species were gradually replaced by native species similar to the native flora, from south to north. The above results suggest that Chinese temples have very rich plant resource and that their effective protection may play a positive role in maintaining regional biodiversity and improving urban greening.},

The book seeks to explain what China is doing and what its immediate and long-term interests are. It is not to defend or judge China. It does not employ theoretical frameworks that are not appropriate for describing Chinese conditions. It calls for understanding why history is particularly relevant to the Chinese state and most of its people.

We hypothesize that human bitter taste receptor (TAS2R) genes might be relaxed from selective constraints because of the change in diet, use of fire and reliance on other means of toxin avoidance that emerged in human evolution. Here, we examine the intra-specific variations of all 25 genes of the human TAS2R repertoire. Our data show hallmarks of neutral evolution, including similar rates of synonymous (dS) and non-synonymous (dN) nucleotide changes among rare polymorphisms, common polymorphisms and substitutions; no variation in dN/dS among functional domains; segregation of pseudogene alleles within species and fixation of loss-of-function mutations. These results, together with previous findings of large numbers of loss-of-function mutations in olfactory, pheromonal and visual sensory genes in humans, suggest surprisingly reduced sensory capabilities of humans in comparison with many other mammals.},

  abstract = {Rigorous sound correspondence is fundamental to historical linguistics. It serves as a solid start in studying genetic relationship. Regarding the genetic position of Miao-Yao languages, Li (1937) proposed a hypothesis that the SinoTibetan language family consists of Chinese, Tibeto-Burman, Kam-Tai, and Miao-Yao. Benedict (1942; 1975) excluded Miao-Yao from the Sino-Tibetan language family since sound correspondences between Miao-Yao and Chinese were considered to be caused by language contact. The key point in this debate has been ignored for a long time: are the related morphemes proposed in this debate supported by rigorous sound correspondence? In this paper, related morphemes across 11 Miao-Yao languages have been first identified under the requirement of complete sound correspondence, and then analyzed by the Rank Method. The result of the genetic relationship between the 11 Miao-Yao languages has been confirmed. The same procedure has been applied to Sino-Miao-Yao related morphemes, and similar pattern has been found. The Sino-Miao-Yao related morphemes were recognized to be inherited from the common ancestor of Chinese and Miao-Yao. Combined with the result from the perspective of pervasive sound correspondence (Wang 2015), the proposal of a genetic relationship between Chinese and MiaoYao has been supported. The Inexplicability Principle has been used to weaken the possibility of Sino-Miao-Yao related morphemes being induced by borrowing from Chinese to Miao-Yao, since some sound correspondences are unlikely to be explained by natural phonetic mechanisms. Moreover, related morphemes in Chinese and Miao-Yao have been examined from the perspective of Old Chinese, and such an examination also supports the hypothesis of a genetic relationship between Chinese and Miao-Yao languages.},

This book explores visual, literary, and scholarly representations of the Celestial Empire and Western countries against the backdrop of actual encounters.

Special attention goes to the ideals and realities of trade and diplomacy of the Dutch East India Company in China. 'Foreign Devils and Philosophers' approaches global history from a cultural perspective and illuminates the reciprocal dynamic of aversion and admiration: Chinese and Westerners could appear as sages or savages in each other's eyes},

Is it being used simply to provide a historical legitimacy for our preoccupation with the dichotomy of east and west, the rising power oflndia and China and the waning of Europe, and our ambivalence towards globalisation? If it ever had any descriptive or analytic force for scholarship, is this now lost and should we discard the term entirely in our scholarly discourse as misleading at best and leave it for the marketers to exploit as a symbol of luxury and exoticism? This article argues that although the term 'Silk Road' has become a widely used portmanteau term, with apt clarification it is still a meaningful term for scholarship.},

  abstract = {A spice is a seed, fruit, root, bark, or other plant substance primarily used for flavoring or coloring food. Spices are distinguished from herbs, which are the leaves, flowers, or stems of plants used for flavoring or as a garnish. Spices are sometimes used in medicine, religious rituals, cosmetics or perfume production. For example, vanilla is commonly used as an ingredient in fragrance manufacturing.A spice may be available in several forms: fresh, whole dried, or pre-ground dried. Generally, spices are dried. Spices may be ground into a powder for convenience. A whole dried spice has the longest shelf life, so it can be purchased and stored in larger amounts, making it cheaper on a per-serving basis. A fresh spice, such as ginger, is usually more flavorful than its dried form, but fresh spices are more expensive and have a much shorter shelf life. Some spices are not always available either fresh or whole, for example turmeric, and often must be purchased in ground form. Small seeds, such as fennel and mustard seeds, are often used both whole and in powder form. Although health benefits are often claimed for spices, there is not currently not enough research conducted to prove these benefits.India contributes to 75\% of global spice production. This is reflected culturally through their cuisine; historically, the spice trade developed throughout the Indian subcontinent, as well as in East Asia and the Middle East. Europe's demand for spices was among the economic and cultural factors that encouraged exploration in the early modern period.},

  abstract = {It is well known that nutritional intake can vary substantially as a function of demographic variables such as ethnicity and/or sex. Although a variety of factors are known to underlie the relationship between these demographic variables and nutritional intake, it is interesting to speculate that variation in food intake associated with ethnicity or sex may result, in part, from differences in the perceived taste of foods in these different populations. Thus, we initiated a study to evaluate taste responsiveness in different ethnic groups. Moreover, because of the known differences in taste responsiveness between males and females, analyses were stratified by sex. The ethnic groups tested differed significantly from one another in reported perceived taste intensity. Our results showed that Hispanics and African Americans rated taste sensations higher than non-Hispanic Whites and that these differences were more pronounced in males. Understanding the nature of these differences in taste perception is important, because taste perception may contribute to dietary health risk. When attempting to modify diet, individuals of different ethnicities may require personalized interventions that take into account the different sensory experience that these individuals may have when consuming foods.},

  abstract = {From the Publisher: Bad food has a history. Swindled tells it. Through a fascinating mixture of cultural and scientific history, food politics, and culinary detective work, Bee Wilson uncovers the many ways swindlers have cheapened, falsified, and even poisoned our food throughout history. In the hands of people and corporations who have prized profits above the health of consumers, food and drink have been tampered with in often horrifying ways-padded, diluted, contaminated, substituted, mislabeled, misnamed, or otherwise faked. Swindled gives a panoramic view of this history, from the leaded wine of the ancient Romans to today's food frauds-such as fake organics and the scandal of Chinese babies being fed bogus milk powder. Wilson pays special attention to nineteenth-and twentieth-century America and England and their roles in developing both industrial-scale food adulteration and the scientific ability to combat it. As Swindled reveals, modern science has both helped and hindered food fraudsters-increasing the sophistication of scams but also the means to detect them. The big breakthrough came in Victorian England when a scientist first put food under the microscope and found that much of what was sold as genuine coffee was anything but-and that you couldn't buy pure mustard in all of London. Arguing that industrialization, laissez-faire politics, and globalization have all hurt the quality of food, but also that food swindlers have always been helped by consumer ignorance, Swindled ultimately calls for both governments and individuals to be more vigilant. In fact, Wilson suggests, one of our best protections is simply to reeducate ourselves about the joys of food and cooking},

  abstract = {The medieval spice trade between the eleventh and the sixteenth centuries made Europe wealthy. Black pepper was the most important spice in this trade, and if it was most important because of its piquancy, and the evidence indicates as much, then the discovery of the chile (Capsicum annuum and spp.) would have been an ideal substitute for expensive spices from the East. The medieval spice did in fact decline dramatically about the same time as the discovery and diffusion of the chile. The question arises: did the arrival of the chile in the Old World contribute to or cause the decline in the spice trade? By reviewing the spice trade before the discovery of the New World, the Venetian-Mamluke monopoly on that trade, the role of the Portuguese and Dutch in the spice trade, and the European diffusion of the chile after 1492 this article will argue that the chile played no role in the diminishing of the spice trade and that the chile's arrival in Europe and the decline of the East-West spice trade appear to be coincidental and not causal.},

  abstract = {English vocabulary has expanded over centuries by ‘borrowing’ lexical items from other languages (Katamba, 2005; Durkin, 2014). Compared with European languages, non-European languages are never major sources of word borrowing in English, with Chinese staying even more peripheral. Scholars have recorded no more than a few hundred English words of Chinese origin. This, however, does not make it easier to study the etymology and semantics of Chinese loanwords. The complication arises from the various source dialects from which Chinese words were borrowed (Mandarin, Cantonese, Amoy, Hokkien, etc.) and also from transcription processes, in which Chinese logograms are ‘romanised’ into phonetic representations so as to be readable for English speakers. It is a procedure easily affected by the transcribers' own cognition and the transcription systems employed, and the arbitrariness of the above variables contributes much to the fact that the orthography of Chinese loanwords, especially those entering the English language early, are prone to changes. This article aims to shed some light on how the ways of transcription may affect the spelling of Chinese loanwords.},

  abstract = {Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is an end-to-end learning approach for automated translation, with the potential to overcome many of the weaknesses of conventional phrase-based translation systems. Unfortunately, NMT systems are known to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation inference – sometimes prohibitively so in the case of very large data sets and large models. Several authors have also charged that NMT systems lack robustness, particularly when input sentences contain rare words. These issues have hindered NMT’s use in practical deployments and services, where both accuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google’s Neural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these issues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder layers using residual connections as well as attention connections from the decoder network to the encoder. To improve parallelism and therefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final translation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference computations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited set of common sub-word units (“wordpieces”) for both input and output. This method provides a good balance between the flexibility of “character”-delimited models and the efficiency of “word”-delimited models, naturally handles translation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the system. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization procedure and uses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that is most likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. To directly optimize the translation BLEU scores, we consider refining the models by using reinforcement learning, but we found that the improvement in the BLEU scores did not reflect in the human evaluation. On the WMT’14 English-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive results to state-of-the-art. Using a human side-by-side evaluation on a set of isolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of 60\% compared to Google’s phrase-based production system.},

  abstract = {Szechuan peppers, famous for their unique sensation and flavor, are widely used as a food additive and traditional herbal medicine. Zanthoxylum bungeanum and Z. armatum are both commonly recognized as Szechuan peppers, but they have different tastes and effects. The chemical components, genetic characteristics, and suitable habitat of six cultivars were analyzed in this study. The results indicated that Z. armatum contained a larger proportion of volatile oil, whereas Z. bungeanum produced a more non-volatile ether extraction. The average content of volatile oil and non-volatile ether extract of Z. armatum were 11.84 and 11.63\%, respectively, and the average content of volatile oil and non-volatile ether extract of Z. bungeanum were 6.46 and 14.23\%, respectively. Combined with an internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequence characters and chemical PCA results, six cultivars were classified into their own groups, for the two species in particular. The temperature in January and July were the most significant ecological factors influencing the contents of the Z. armatum volatile oil. However, annual precipitation, temperature in January and relevant humidity had a significant positive correlation with the content of non-volatile ether extract in Z. bungeanum. Thus, the most suitable areas for producing Z. bungeanum cultivars ranged from the Hengduan Mountains to the Ta-pa Mountains, and the regions suitable for Z. armatum cultivars were found to be in the Sichuan Basin and Dalou-Wu mountains. The predicted suitable habitat could be used as a preliminary test area for Szechuan pepper cultivar production.},

  abstract = {This paper examines both synaesthetic and conceptual metaphors of BITTERNESS and PAIN in Chinese and English. In terms of synaesthetic metaphor, BITTERNESS is more versatile than PAIN, as the former can be transferred to more sensory domains than the latter. Regardless of the sensory domains, the synaesthetic metaphor basically inherits the negative polarity in both Chinese and English. Regarding conceptual metaphor, both BITTERNESS and PAIN exhibit noticeable cross-linguistic differences. Specifically, EFFORT IS BITTERNESS and INTENSITY IS PAIN are attested in Chinese, while EFFORT IS PAIN and INTENSITY IS BITTERNESS are in operation in English. Whenever EFFORT is targeted, the expression at issue obliterates the negative sense of BITTER and PAIN, probably because the concept of “effort” is cross-culturally positive.},

  abstract = {我国是一个历史悠久的文明古国,文化遗产积淀丰厚,香文化源远流长,在香料生产与利用方面积累了大量的技术经验,香料贸易则是我国古代朝贡贸易的重要组成部分,对当时的社会生活产生了深远影响。传统香料按来源划分,可分为动物香料和植物香料,动物香料只有麝香（Musk）、灵猫香（civet）、海狸香（Castoreum）、龙涎香（Ambergris）四种,而植物香料到目前为止被发现的有五百种左右。植物香料在人们起居生活中无所不在,其气味芳香、性质独特,在薰香、美容化妆、饮食调味、医药保健、宗教祭祀等方面应用广泛,作用无可替代。但迄今为止,相关的专题研究非常稀少,研究成果寥若晨星。中国古代植物香料的生产、利用与贸易问题值得全面探讨和深入研究。本论文首先对中国古代主要香料植物的种类、性状和地理分布进行简要介绍。这些最常见的香料植物主要有沉香、乳香、檀香、松香、甘草、白芷、豆蔻、胡椒、花椒、藿香、薄荷、排草香、薰衣草、茉莉、玫瑰、姜、韭、葱、蒜等。芳香植物按其取材部位,可分为树脂类、芳香花草类、香材类、果类和根茎类香料;按其功用,可分为香辛蔬菜与调味类、药用保健类和香化环境类;按其产地,可分为本土香料植物和外来香料植物;按其加工后的形态,又可分为原态香材、线香、篾香、盘香、香丸、香粉、香膏、香汤、香脑油等。不同香料植物的性状各不相同,地理分布也存在明显的地域差异,本文在对其进行简要介绍的同时,为了更清晰展示其全貌,将全国分为华东、华南、华北、西南、西北、东北等六个地区,利用图表形式展示古代文献中有关香料植物的性状和地理分布的原始记录。中国古代植物香料的栽培、加工和贮藏历史悠久。本论文主要从中国古代的农业技术角度,探讨香辛蔬菜、调味料和薰香料等芳香植物的栽培方法。早在《诗经》时代,人们就已经掌握了一些野生香辛植物引进园圃进行栽培和改良的相关技术,培育出葱、姜、蒜、韭、薤、桂、椒、蒿、芷、香橼等多种本土香料。其栽培方法主要有选种、下种、移植、压条、扦插,详细说明古人在生产生活实践中,栽培香辛蔬菜和调味料技术已呈现多样化趋势。同时,他们也懂得将茉莉、排草香、水仙、柑橘、土沉香等薰香料类芳香植物的越冬防寒技术,其主要有室内盆栽保暖和以土培根等。总的来说,我国古代香料植物的人工栽培规模大小不一,以小规模的园圃形式为主。另外,土沉香是古代中国特有的树脂类薰香料,因其自然资源稀少,且只能在气候温暖湿润的岭南一些地区的沙质土壤中生长,所以,只有依靠人工栽培才能满足需求,但栽培环境要求严格,所以文中对其人工栽培问题还特书一笔。栽培并出售香料植物获得经济来源是一些古人的谋生手段之一,虽然在不同的历史时期和地域,这一谋生手段的地位和作用存在差别,但本文对这一问题也给予了简要的论述,在于强调我国古代百姓贾农,为了谋生而从事植物香料生产经营的经济目的。先人们在植物香料的加工、贮藏方面手段多样,并积累了丰富的经验,且相关技术日趋成熟,值得我们研究和借鉴。总体上讲,我国古代植物香料的加工炮制方法主要有水制、火制和水火合制三种。其中,水制又可分为洗、漂、泡、渍、水飞等;火制包括煅、炮、煨、炒、烘、焙、炙等;水火合制主要有蒸、煮、淬等。在古代中国,植物香料的贮藏方法多种多样,可谓举不胜举。限于论文篇幅,本研究只对龙脑香、柑橘、姜等几种薰香料、香果与香蔬的贮藏方法作重点介绍,并着重对其保鲜防腐、防治蠹虫、防止香味散失等加工、贮藏技术进行梳理。最后交待了中国古代宫廷与民间制香的发展历程。中国古代植物香料的利用历时悠远,途径多种,影响深远,意义重大。有关这一问题,本文着重探讨以下几个方面的问题:植物香料与中国古代的薰香、美容、饮食、医疗、保健和宗教祭祀。在薰香生活中,利用植物香料制作的薰香料扮演着举足轻重的角色,一直受到重视。文中首先追溯了中国古代薰香的历史渊源,接着分别着重叙述了隋、唐、五代、宋、元、明、清时期薰香的发展过程;在此基础上,对我国古代植物香料与传统制香业特别是是宫廷贵族的薰香调配、制作、使用作了概括性介绍,凸现植物香料在宫廷生活中的重要地位。同时,介绍了历代薰香料（合香）的调配与制作技术,利用玉片、银叶、砂片、云母等进行隔火薰香的方法,薰香炉具的品种、款式、质地与使用方法的演变等。中国古代香妆品有着悠久的历史,远在三千多年前的夏、商时期,就有了利用芳香植物美容化妆的文献记载。古代香妆品的主要成份来自于天然香料植物,所以,植物香料与中国古代美容化妆关系密切。针对这一问题,文章首先全面阐述了中国古代香妆品使用的大致发展历程,其结论是:先秦时期粉和胭脂的一般利用,南北朝时期寿阳妆、红妆的出现与流行,隋唐时期化妆技术成熟,盛装和浓妆是这一时期的特点,宋元时期流行淡雅、含蓄面妆,明清时期香精提炼技术成熟,香妆品的品种开始繁多。最后,分别介绍中国古代口脂、面脂、胭脂、香粉、藻豆、香泽、香露和眉黛等各种香妆品的使用与制作,从美白、去斑、去皱、润肤等角度,专门探讨独具特色的中国古代医学芳香美容,为我国现代美容技术的发展提供历史借鉴。植物香料与中国古代饮食、医药、宗教祭祀等活动密不可分,饮食、薰香、化妆、医药、宗教祭祀是植物香料的主要功能。笔者为此着重探讨三个方面的问题:一是植物香料与中国古代饮食之间的关系。主要包括植物香料在烹饪调味、香茶加工利用、香酒加工利用过程中利用;二是植物香料在中国古代医药保健中的作用。上古时期,先民在顺应自然、改造自然的活动中,凭藉观其形、闻其气和尝其味,在长期实践过程中,逐渐认识到自然界中一些芳香植物的医药保健作用,这些具有医药功能的芳香植物也就是香药。香药以其令人愉快的气味被先民所喜欢,又因其独特的药用效果为先民所利用,辛、温、热是古人对香药性质的根本认识。古代医家甚至把香药特别划为一个门类列入其著作当中,成为先民最早认识并广泛用之于临床的中药。本文主要论述了“香药”利用的历史沿革,包括古人对香料植物制作的香药性状的认识、利用和加工炮制,以及香药在医疗保健中的利用等一系列问题;三是植物香料在古代各种形式的祭祀活动中扮演的角色。在宗教中,“香”自古被认为具有通达上天的作用,是神灵的使者。本研究主要探讨了古代祭天祀祖、佛教和道教仪式中植物香料的使用情况。为了寻求政治、军事和贸易保护,古代很多邻邦奉强盛的中国为宗主国,派使者携带香料、象牙等物品来到中国进献给朝廷。有时地方政府为取悦于朝廷也会向朝廷进献特产香料。香料是中国古代域外和各级地方政府的主要朝贡品,在中国古代的朝贡贸易中担当着重要角色,有时甚至起着其它物品不可替代的作用。通过朝贡而来的域外植物香料,扩大了中国古代植物香料的来源,增加了植物香料的品种,对这一问题的探讨,有助于我们进一步了解中国古代植物香料与域外植物香料之间的关系。对各个历史时期地方政府向朝廷进献植物香料行为的研究,也有助于我们扩大了解中国古代本土植物香料的一些情况。为了便于研究中国古代香料的朝贡贸易问题,笔者把中国古代分为五个时段,分别探讨了魏晋南北朝及其以前、隋唐五代、宋元、明、清时期的香料朝贡贸易,分析香料朝贡贸易的原因、实质与作用,研究香料朝贡贸易的影响,尤其注重对宋代、明代和清代的香料朝贡贸易问题进行研究,分析在各自的历史背景下香料朝贡贸易的原因及其对中国古代政治、经济、文化和社会生活等产生的影响。毋庸讳言,尽管在本论文在撰写过程中,笔者广泛地搜集资料,进行了多方位的研究和探讨,由于资料、时间和个人水平等因素,文章存在不足甚至舛误之处在所难免,如对植物香料的种类和地理分布阐述不够系统全面,对植物香料的利用问题探讨有待于深入,对中国古代香料朝贡贸易问题分析还不十分透彻,等等。期望本研究能够弥补学界研究之不足、拓展科技史研究范围,给当今香料、香精、化妆品产业提供历史借鉴和参考,为继承和发展中国古代“香文化遗产”尽绵薄之力。my country is an ancient civilization with a long history, rich in cultural heritage, and a long history of incense culture. It has accumulated a lot of technical experience in the production and utilization of spices. The spice trade is an important part of the ancient tribute trade in my country. had a profound impact. Traditional spices can be divided into animal spices and plant spices according to their sources. Animal spices are only musk (Musk), civet (civet), castoreum (Castoreum), and ambergris (Ambergris). About 500 species have been discovered. Plant spices are ubiquitous in people's daily life, with their aromatic smell and unique properties, they are widely used in aromatherapy, beauty and makeup, food seasoning, medicine and health care, religious sacrifices, etc., and their role is irreplaceable. But so far, the relevant special researches are very rare, and the research results are few and far between. The production, utilization and trade of ancient Chinese plant spices are worthy of comprehensive discussion and in-depth research. This paper first briefly introduces the types, characters and geographical distribution of the main spice plants in ancient China. These most common spice plants mainly include agarwood, frankincense, sandalwood, rosin, licorice, angelica dahurica, cardamom, pepper, pepper, patchouli, mint, herbal incense, lavender, jasmine, rose, ginger, leek, onion, garlic, etc. Aromatic plants can be divided into resins, aromatic flowers and plants, aromatic materials, fruits and rhizome spices according to their parts; according to their functions, they can be divided into spicy vegetables and seasoning, medicinal health care and aroma environment; According to its place of origin, it can be divided into local spice plants and exotic spice plants; according to its processed form, it can be divided into original incense materials, incense sticks, stick incense, coil incense, incense pills, incense powder, balm, incense Soup, peppermint oil, etc. The traits of different spice plants are different, and there are obvious regional differences in geographical distribution. In this paper, while briefly introducing them, in order to show their overall picture more clearly, the whole country is divided into East China, South China, North China, Southwest China, Northwest China and Northeast China. The original records of the traits and geographical distribution of spice plants in ancient literature were displayed in the form of diagrams. The cultivation, processing and storage of ancient Chinese plant spices have a long history. This paper mainly discusses the cultivation methods of aromatic plants such as spicy vegetables, seasonings and incense from the perspective of ancient Chinese agricultural technology. As early as the "Book of Songs" era, people have mastered the related technologies of introducing some wild spice plants into gardens for cultivation and improvement, and cultivated onion, ginger, garlic, leek, scallion, osmanthus, pepper, artemisia, zhi, citron, etc. native spices. Its cultivation methods mainly include seed selection, sowing, transplanting, layering, and cuttings. In detail, in the production and life practice of the ancients, the cultivation of spicy vegetables and seasoning techniques has shown a trend of diversification. At the same time, they also know the overwintering and cold protection techniques of aromatic plants such as jasmine, paicaoxiang, narcissus, citrus, and agarwood, which mainly include indoor potted plants to keep warm and soil bacon. Generally speaking, the artificial cultivation scales of spice plants in ancient my country vary, mainly in the form of small-scale gardens. In addition, agarwood is a unique resinous incense in ancient China. Because of the scarcity of natural resources, it can only grow in sandy soil in some areas in the south of the Five Ridges with a warm and humid climate. Therefore, only artificial cultivation can meet the demand, but cultivation The environmental requirements are strict, so there is a special book about its artificial cultivation in this paper. Cultivating and selling spice plants to obtain economic resources is one of the means of livelihood of some ancient people. Although the status and function of this means of livelihood are different in different historical periods and regions, this article also gives a brief discussion on this issue. It is to emphasize the economic purpose of Jia Nong, a common man in ancient my country, engaged in the production and management of plant spices in order to make a living. The ancestors have various methods in the processing and storage of plant spices, and have accumulated rich experience, and the related technologies are becoming more and more mature, which is worthy of our study and reference. Generally speaking, there are three main methods of processing plant spices in ancient my country: water, fire and water-fire combination. Among them, the water system can be divided into washing, bleaching, soaking, soaking, water flying, etc.; the fire system includes calcining, firing, simmering, frying, baking, roasting, broiling, etc.; In ancient China, there were various storage methods for plant spices, which can be described as too numerous to mention. Due to the limited length of the paper, this study only focuses on the storage methods of dipterocarp, citrus, ginger and other spices, fragrant fruits and fragrant vegetables, and focuses on the processing and storage of fresh-keeping and antisepsis, silverfish control, and fragrance loss prevention. technology sorting out. Finally, the development process of ancient Chinese court and folk incense making is explained. The utilization of plant spices in ancient China has a long history and various ways, with far-reaching influence and great significance. Regarding this issue, this article focuses on the following aspects: plant spices and ancient Chinese incense, beauty, diet, medical treatment, health care and religious sacrifices. In the incense life, the incense made of plant spices plays a pivotal role and has always been valued. This article first traces the historical origin of incense in ancient my country, and then focuses on the development process of incense in Sui, Tang, Five Dynasties, Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties; The incense industry, especially the incense blending, production and use of the court nobles, is given a general introduction, highlighting the important position of plant spices in court life. At the same time, it introduces the blending and production technology of incense (hexiang) in the past dynasties, the method of using jade flakes, silver leaves, sand flakes, mica, etc. evolution etc. Ancient Chinese fragrances and cosmetics have a long history. As far back as the Xia and Shang dynasties more than 3,000 years ago, there have been records of using aromatic plants for beauty and makeup. The main ingredients of ancient cosmetics come from natural spice plants, so plant spices are closely related to ancient Chinese beauty and makeup. In response to this problem, the article first comprehensively expounds the general development process of the use of ancient Chinese cosmetics. The conclusions are: the general use of powder and rouge in the pre-Qin period, the appearance and popularity of Shouyang makeup and red makeup in the Southern and Northern Dynasties, and the makeup technology in the Sui and Tang Dynasties. Maturity, costumes and heavy makeup are the characteristics of this period. Elegant and subtle facial makeup was popular in the Song and Yuan Dynasties. In the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the essence extraction technology was mature, and the varieties of fragrance cosmetics began to increase. Finally, it introduces the use and production of ancient Chinese cosmetics such as lip balm, face balm, rouge, face powder, algae beans, fragrance, fragrance dew and eyebrow cream, from whitening, freckle removal, wrinkle removal, skin moisturizing, etc. From the angle of view, it specifically discusses the unique ancient Chinese medical aroma cosmetology, and provides historical reference for the development of modern cosmetology technology in our country. Plant spices are inseparable from ancient Chinese diet, medicine, religious sacrifices and other activities. Diet, aromatherapy, makeup, medicine, and religious sacrifices are the main functions of plant spices. The author focuses on three aspects: one is the relationship between plant spices and ancient Chinese diet. It mainly includes the use of plant spices in cooking seasoning, processing and utilization of fragrant tea, and processing and utilization of fragrant wine; the second is the role of plant spices in ancient Chinese medicine and health care. In ancient times, in the activities of conforming to and transforming nature, the ancestors gradually realized the medical and health functions of some aromatic plants in nature by observing their shape, smelling their breath and tasting their taste. Functional aromatic plants are also fragrant medicines. Aromatic medicine was liked by the ancestors for its pleasant smell, and was used by the ancestors because of its unique medicinal effect. Pungent, warm and hot are the basic understanding of the properties of fragrant medicine by the ancients. Ancient physicians even classified fragrant medicine as a special category and included it in their works, which became the earliest traditional Chinese medicine recognized by the ancestors and widely used in clinical practice. This paper mainly discusses the historical evolution of the utilization of "fragrant medicine", including a series of issues such as the ancients' understanding, utilization and processing of aromatic medicines made from spice plants, and the use of fragrant medicines in medical care; the third is the use of plant spices in The role played in various forms of sacrificial activities in ancient times. In religion, "fragrance" has been believed to have the function of reaching the heavens since ancient times, and is the messenger of the gods. This study mainly explores the use of plant spices in ancient rituals of offering sacrifices to heaven and ancestors, Buddhism and Taoism. In order to seek political, military and trade protection, many neighboring countries in ancient times regarded the powerful China as their suzerain, and sent envoys to China with spices, ivory and other items to present to the imperial court. Sometimes local governments will also offer special spices to the imperial court in order to please the imperial court. Spices were the main tribute products of foreign and local governments in ancient China. They played an important role in the tribute trade in ancient China, and sometimes even played an irreplaceable role for other items. The extraterritorial plant spices brought by tribute have expanded the source of ancient Chinese plant spices and increased the variety of plant spices. The discussion of this issue will help us further understand the relationship between ancient Chinese plant spices and extraterritorial plant spices. . The research on the behavior of local governments donating plant spices to the imperial court in various historical periods will also help us to expand our understanding of some of the local plant spices in ancient China. In order to facilitate the study of the tribute trade of spices in ancient China, the author divides ancient China into five periods, respectively discussing the tribute trade of spices in the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties and before, Sui, Tang, and Five Dynasties, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, and analyzing the spice tribute trade. The reasons, substance and function of the spice tributary trade are studied, and the influence of the spice tribute trade is studied, especially focusing on the study of the spice tribute trade in the Song, Ming and Qing dynasties, and the reasons for the spice tribute trade in their respective historical backgrounds and their influence on ancient Chinese politics, economic, cultural and social life. Needless to say, although the author extensively collected materials and conducted multi-faceted research and discussions during the writing process of this paper, due to factors such as data, time and personal level, it is inevitable that the article has deficiencies or even mistakes, such as The types and geographical distribution of plant spices are not described systematically and comprehensively, the utilization of plant spices needs to be further explored, the analysis of the tribute trade of spices in ancient China is not very thorough, and so on. It is hoped that this study can make up for the lack of academic research, expand the scope of research on the history of science and technology, provide historical reference and reference for today's spices, flavors, and cosmetics industries, and contribute to the inheritance and development of ancient Chinese "fragrance cultural heritage".},

  abstract = {Medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) have accompanied mankind from its very early beginnings. Their utilization has co-evolved with homo sapiens itself. Evolution has brought about a profound increase in our scientific knowledge about these species, so that, to date, they find utilization in many facets of our life (eg. pharmaceutical products, feed- and food additives, cosmetics, etc.). Remarkably today, despite the new renaissance of MAPs usage, ca. 80 \% of the world's population relies upon natural substances of plant origin, with most of these botanicals sourced from the wild state. This huge increase in demand has put an unparalleled large burden on the natural resources of MAPs endangering their existence. The first volume of the series Medicinal Plants of the World, will briefly summarize the most essential current scientific knowledge about the sustainable sourcing of botanicals from both wild-crafting and cultivation. In these 21 chapters, eminent researchers of the topic will summarize latest scientific knowledge from the versatile and most varied scientific disciplines involved: botany, phytochemistry, plant breeding, biotechnology, agrotechnology, mechanization and economics. Individual chapters will deal with the essentials of phytomedical utilization, as well as utilization in the form of animal feed-additives. The volume concludes with a chapter on the poisonous MAPs in our homes, offices and modern everyday environments. The aim of this volume is to offer basic scientific information on MAPs. It will also enable readers of subsequent volumes to digest and interpret the other volumes in the series, that will deal with important and characteristic wild-crafted and cultivated MAPs of the different geographic and climatic regions of the world. Thus, the series is meant to be a storehouse of up-to-date information on our global wealth of medicinal and aromatic plants on the basis of which MAPs will be collected, cultivated, traded and utilized in a sustainable way.},

  abstract = {The first section of this article begins by investigating the term “going down to the Western Oceans” (xia xiyang 下西洋), which was used as early as the time of Zheng He. It also discusses the origin of the concepts of the Eastern and Western Oceans. The second section discusses the influx of overseas geographical knowledge into China before the time of Zheng He, especially over two important periods: first, the coming of Indian geographical knowledge along with Buddhism to China from the Wei-Jin period (220–420 ce), and second, the advent of Islamic geographical knowledge during the Mongol-Yuan period (ca. 1206–1368). The third section discusses the contributions of foreign members in Zheng He’s fleet, especially fanhuozhang 番火長 (foreign pilot). Through an analysis of the records of three military encounters—the suppression of the pirate Chen Zuyi 陳祖義, the attack on Ceylon, and the battle with pirates on a return journey—we find that the term fanhuozhang appears in all three cases, showing that foreign experts were commonly present in all branches or segments of Zheng He’s fleet, and that it must have been their job to navigate in the Indian ocean portion of the journey. Based on these findings, the author suggests that even before the beginning of Ming, Chinese people had developed an understanding of navigation technology and absorbed expertise from other peoples, and that this knowledge formed the technological foundation of Zheng He’s long-distance voyages, evident of the fact that China’s ancient navigational technology was an open knowledge system.},

  abstract = {本文以《全宋词》中香事类词汇为研究对象。所谓“香事类词汇”是指人们在用香、熏香、焚香等活动中所涉及到的有关香料、香品、香具和用香习俗等方面的词汇。本文对《全宋词》中香事类词语进行了系统的整理和多角度的考察,论述了香事类词语的构词方式、特点等,并旁及《汉语大词典》收词、释义与书证方面的问题。 本文分为五个部分。 第一部分为绪论,简述本文研究的缘起和研究意义；综述《全宋词》香事类词语的研究现状,指出目前研究涉及的内容与存在的空白,明确本文的研究内容和研究目的；说明本文的研究思路和研究方法。 第二部分,描述《全宋词》香事类词汇概貌。首先分门别类介绍了《全宋词》香事类词语的类别,然后讨论了《全宋词》香事类词汇体系的构成,最后分析了《全宋词》香事类词语构词方式。 第三部分,论述《全宋词》香事类词语特点。《全宋词》香事类词语独具特色,或构词语素形象雅丽,或异词同指现象普遍,或异实同名现象普遍,或同素逆序的同义词大量存在,或部分词语语义发生了转移。 第四部分,探讨《全宋词》香事类词语与《汉语大词典》的订补。通过把《全宋词》香事类词语与《汉语大词典》所收香事类词语进行比对,指出了《汉语大词典》在收词、释义和书证方面的一些疏失。 第五部分为结语。对本文的主要观点和研究工作进行小结,并说明研究工作存在的不足之处和今后的努力方向。This article takes the vocabulary of fragrant things in "Quan Song Ci" as the research object. The so-called "incense-related vocabulary" refers to the vocabulary related to spices, incense products, incense utensils and incense-using customs involved in people's activities such as using incense, incense, and burning incense. This paper systematically organizes and inspects the words of Xiangshi in "Quan Song Ci", discusses the word formation and characteristics of Xiangshi words, and also discusses the collection, interpretation and documentary evidence of "Chinese Dictionary" The problem. This article is divided into five parts. The first part is the introduction, which briefly describes the origin and significance of this study; summarizes the research status of the incense words in "The Complete Song Ci", points out the content and gaps in the current research, and clarifies the research content and purpose of this article; research ideas and research methods. The second part describes the general appearance of Xiangshi vocabulary in "Quan Song Ci". Firstly, it introduces the categories of Xiangshi words in "Quan Song Ci" by category, then discusses the composition of "Quan Song Ci" Xiangshi vocabulary system, and finally analyzes the word formation method of "Quan Song Ci" Xiangshi words. The third part discusses the characteristics of Xiangshi words in "Quan Song Ci". The Xiangshi words in "The Complete Song Ci" are unique, or the morphological elements of the words are elegant, or the phenomenon of different words with the same meaning is common, or the phenomenon of the same name with different entities is common, or there are a large number of synonyms with the same prime and reverse order, or the semantics of some words have changed. transfer. The fourth part discusses the revision and supplementation of the Xiangshi words in the "Quan Song Ci" and the "Chinese Dictionary". By comparing the Xiangshi words in the "Quan Song Ci" with the Xiangshi words collected in the "Chinese Dictionary", it points out some omissions in the "Chinese Dictionary" in terms of word collection, interpretation and documentary evidence. The fifth part is the conclusion. Summarize the main points of view and research work of this paper, and explain the shortcomings of the research work and the direction of future efforts.},

  abstract = {Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim. (Rutaceae) is a popular food additive and traditional Chinese herbal medicine commonly named HuaJiao in China. This plant is widely distributed in Asian countries. The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic review on the traditional usages, botany, phytochemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of this plant. Furthermore, the possible development and perspectives for future research on this plant are also discussed. To date, over 140 compounds have been isolated and identified from Z. bungeanum, including alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, and free fatty acids. The extracts and compounds have been shown to possess wide-ranging biological activity, such as anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, antioxidant and anti-tumor effects, antibacterial and antifungal effects, as well as regulatory effects on the gastrointestinal system and nervous system, and other effects. As a traditional herbal medicine, Z. bungeanum has been widely used to treat many diseases, especially digestive disorders, toothache, stomach ache, and diarrhea. Many traditional usages of this plant have been validated by present investigations. However, further research elucidating the structure-function relationship among chemical compounds, understanding the mechanism of unique sensation, as well as exploring new clinical effects and establishing criteria for quality control for Z. bungeanum should be further studied.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the mapping directionality tendencies of linguistic synesthesia in Mandarin using a corpus-based approach. Based on this set of less-studied data, we find that Mandarin synesthesia does not share the same directionality tendencies with linguistic synesthesia in Indo-European languages, which challenges the assumed cross-linguistic universality of these transfer patterns. Based on the corpus data, we demonstrate that there are three types of directional tendencies for Mandarin synesthesia: unidirectional, biased-directional, and bidirectional. Unidirectional synesthesia is rule-based, while synesthesia that is biased in one direction is frequency-based. In contrast, bidirectional synesthesia shows no directional preference. Thus, the directionality of linguistic synesthesia cannot be interpreted as rule-based or frequency-based exclusively. In addition, this study finds that linguistic synesthesia shows language-specific variations for directionality tendencies grounded in both embodiment and neural mechanisms, which challenges the theory that linguistic synesthesia is a bio-neurologically based linguistic realization. Lastly, the fact that linguistic synesthesia involves both rule-based and frequency-based transfer directionalities suggests that the relationship between linguistic synesthesia and metaphor merits further exploration.},

Based on a lexical analysis of Mandarin synesthetic usages, we find that (1) linguistic synesthesia maps the metaphorical meaning between two domains; and (2) linguistic synesthetic mappings and conceptual metaphoric mappings have similar behaviors when sense modalities are treated as conceptual domains that contain a set of mappings constrained by Mapping Principles. This lexical-conceptual account is designed to capture the fact that linguistic synesthesia involves mapping between lexicalized concepts of sensory properties, instead of the real-time sensory input that is processed in neurological synesthesia. The incorporation of a lexical semantic view with the framework of Conceptual Metaphor Theory not only offers a coherent and comprehensive account for the nature of linguistic synesthesia, but also handles aspects of linguistic synesthesia previously only accounted for by nonmetaphorical accounts. These design features make this proposal the most comprehensive account to fit the current data. Furthermore, by showing linguistic synesthesia as a type of metaphor, our study strengthens the role of conceptual metaphors as the link between the perceived world and our conceptualization of that world.},

  abstract = {Linguistic synaesthesia involving description of one sensory modality in terms of concepts from another sensory modality, such as sweet voice and 冷色 leng3 se4 'cold color', is employed across discourse types (i.e., poetic and ordinary), time periods (i.e., synchronic and diachronic), and language families (e.g., Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, and Semitic). The kind of language use has, however, not received much attention in linguistic research, although manifesting as mapping from one bodily domain to another bodily domain would pose challenges to Conceptual Metaphor Theory and the theory of embodiment. This thesis thus aimed to conduct a systematic and comprehensive lexical semantic study on linguistic synaesthesia of Mandarin sensory adjectives from a corpus-based approach, to explore the tendencies of Mandarin synaesthesia, and to examine the theoretical implications of linguistic synaesthesia. This study proposed a linguistic synaesthesia identification procedure (LSIP) to extract synaesthetic data for Mandarin sensory adjectives from the Sinica corpus, which was adapted from Pragglejaz Group (2007)'s well-established metaphor identification procedure (MIP). The proposed identification procedure for linguistic synaesthesia was demonstrated to be also applicable to other languages from other corpora. Based on the distribution of the collected synaesthetic usages of Mandarin sensory adjectives, the study found that Mandarin synaesthesia exhibited directionality mapping from more embodied senses to less embodied ones, analogous to the attested patterns of linguistic synaesthesia in Indo-European, Hebrew, and Indonesian languages. The directionality of Mandarin synaesthesia is, however, tendencies-based. In addition, Mandarin synaesthesia was attested to show language-specific characteristics when compared to the established tendencies of English synaesthesia, hence inconsistent with the proposal of cross-lingual universality of synaesthetic patterns. The distribution and directionality of Mandarin synaesthesia demonstrated that neither the embodiment account nor the biological association account of linguistic synaesthesia could be fully supported. The thesis thus suggested an incorporated theoretical model containing both embodiment mechanisms and biological mechanisms, to account for the synaesthetic tendencies of Mandarin sensory adjectives and the language-specific characteristics of linguistic synaesthesia in Mandarin Chinese. Besides, this study has shown that linguistic synaesthesia is a type of metaphor as a linguistic realization of conceptual metaphors, which should be taken into consideration by Conceptual Metaphor Theory. The thesis therefore argued for a finer-grained account of embodiment covering the notions of the degree of embodiment and the type of embodied events, to refine Conceptual Metaphor Theory and the theory of embodiment.},

  abstract = {Description of flavours of desserts often involves a rich range of vocabulary. This paper investigates the real-life language describing tastes of desserts in Mandarin Chinese, extracting data from Dazhong Dianping, the most popular restaurant review website in China. Using the Sketch Engine as the primary tool to extract collocations, we found that ‘mouthfeel’ and ‘personality’, instead of direct descriptions of TASTE or SMELL, are the most dominant expressions. In particular, more than one hundred ‘mouthfeel’ words are identified, with strong tendency of positive polarity. The majority of ‘mouthfeel’ terms are tactile (sense of touch) in nature, which shall be considered as synaesthetic metaphors to depict TASTE. Moreover, these ‘mouthfeel’ words often collocate with words connoting pleasant personality, especially in terms of warm social interactions. In summary, due to its intensional rather than physical telicity, description of desserts shows significant cultural variations. On the one hand, the preferred words still retain the same telic purpose, i.e., to please the mouth; on the other hand, instead of using expressions conveying intensional bodily pleasure (sensuality/sexuality), Chinese focus both on the parochial bodily experience (pleasing the mouth) as well as the social-interactional (pleasant personality) to describe desserts.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Perfumes have been known as utilizable but exclusive products since antiquity. Use of aromatic substances was first mentioned in archaic sources of the ancient world. The origin of such fragrant substances was mainly vegetable and animal. Throughout history, the use of subtle perfumes increased and some of the exotic materials became expensive and valuable commodities. They were the source of wealth for cultures and rulers. The contribution of the Arabs to the distribution of new crops, knowledge, industrial techniques and substances is a well-known phenomenon. In our article we intend to focus on the new perfumes that were distributed throughout the world thanks to the Arab conquests and the knowledge of their other uses, mainly medicinal, that was handed down along with the products themselves. About 20 common perfumes are known to have been used in the medieval world, though half of them were not mentioned in earlier sources.             These phenomena will be dealt with and presented in a profile we built up for four perfumes: agarwood, camphor, musk and ambergris. The theoretical and practical uses of these perfumes that are presented in detail (based on various sources including traders’ documents, medical literature and practical Genizah fragments, dealing mainly with medicine) will serve as case studies for the understanding of new trends in the uses of perfumes after the Muslim conquest. Arab perfumes can be divided into three groups, according to their level of importance:                            A.               New perfumes, mainly from the vast region named “India”; most of which (such as camphor, ambergris and sandalwood and a compound made out of them known as               nadd               and               ghāliya               ) were not known in the Middle East and the Mediterranean region until the Muslim conquests.                                         B.               Perfumes that kept their popularity including: a variety of cinnamon, costus, spikenard, frankincense, saffron and rose.                                         C.               Perfumes that lost their worth like balsam and myrrh.                          It seems that camphor was the best and most cherished perfume that substituted balsam. Like balsam, the importance of myrrh that was imported from Arabia and East Africa also declined and it seems that its substitute was musk. Transformations in perfume fashion were in fact only part of a wider revolution of the Arabic material culture which the Middle East, the Mediterranean region and even many European countries experienced due to the Arab conquests.},
