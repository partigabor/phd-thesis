\begin{etymology}\label{ety:huixiang}
Mandarin Chinese {茴香} \textit{huíxiāng} `fennel' [hui-spice], 茴 \textit{hui} refers to fennel, anise, and related plants; it perhaps could be rendered as `muslim spice' by way of its construction: 回 `Islam; Hui people' +  艹 `grass, herb' (Hu, 2005); or, phono semantic compund\footnote{\textcite{hu_food_2005}}
