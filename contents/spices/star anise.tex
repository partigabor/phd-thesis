Star anise is a spice consisting of the dried fruits of the tree \textit{Illicium verum}. 

% DAVIDSON:
% a spice consisting of the small, star-shaped, dried fruits of Illicium verum, a slender evergreen tree of the family Illicaceae related to Magnoliacea. This is not known in the wild state, but is assumed to be indigenous to China. It is not a relation of anise, but shares with it the same essential oil, anethole, which is used for flavouring some drinks and confectionery; star anise is the principal commercial source of anethole.

% The appearance of the fruit is remarkable. Eight (rarely, 9 or 10) carpels attached to a central column produce the starlike shape. These carpels, which can be over 15 mm (0.25") long and are often irregularly developed, are dark reddish-brown in colour; each normally contains one hard light brown seed.

% Cultivation, which is not easy, is almost entirely confined to S. China and parts of SE Asia.

% Star anise is one of the ingredients of (Chinese) five spice. Jill Norman (1990) observes that it occurs in some western recipes for syrups and jams in the 17th century; and that some western chefs now use it in, for example, fish stews. In China it has been associated with pork and poultry.

\subsection{The History of Star Anise}

Star anise has been known in China as a spice and medicine for over 3,000 years. When in 970 AD, the southern states lost a cruel and merciless war with the Chinese emperor, they had to pay war reparations in star anise. The English pirate Sir Thomas Cavendish brought star anise to Europe from the Philippines in 1588. It began appearing in European kitchens during the 17th century as an aromatic agent added to tea in the Russian Czar's court. It was not used in Germany until the end of the 18th century. The genus name Illicium comes from the Latin illicere, meaning lure or attract.
