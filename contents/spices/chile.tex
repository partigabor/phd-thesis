% The chile was probably introduced shortly after this, perhaps in the 1520s, for “by 1542, three separate varieties of chilli were growing in India, mainly on the west coast and especially in Goa. Chillis first became well known in Bombay under the name Gowai mirchi (Goan pepper). According to Clusius in his Exoticorum (1605), the chilli pepper was also cultivated in India under the name Pernambuco [a Brazilian port city] pepper.”15


% Exactly when each of these introductions occurred is difficult to pinpoint. As mentioned above, gazetteers are generally an excellent source for tracing the introduction of other new crops. However, as is evidenced in the large lag in the record between the earliest source to mention the chile (1591) and the first appearance in a gazetteer (1671), gazetteers are not a particularly reliable source for Map 1.2 Dates of the earliest texts with chiles by province.
