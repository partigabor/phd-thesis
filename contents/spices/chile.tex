Chile, chili, or chilli, is the pod-like fruit of various species of \textit{Capsicums}, most prominently \textit{Capsicum annuum}, \textit{C. frutescens} their countless \glspl{cultivar}, but other species are used as a spice as well. The chili pepper---as it is conventionally called---is used both fresh and dry, and it is the most recognizable spice of our time. Since its rapid diffusion across the globe with the \gls{Columbian}, it dominates many of the world's dishes and cuisines with its heat and aromatic flavor. 
% Many books have been written about the success of chili, and I do not want to enumerate the words 

\subsection{The Botany, Origins, and Cultivation of Chile}

\subsection{The History of Chile}

The history of the chili is very well documented, and its diffusion is a well known historical phenomenon after the initial European contact. In his writings Columbus only mentions \textit{ají}, and its extreme heat, but the Europeans were so set on finding spices that was already known to them, that the excitement of this new spice---the chile pepper---evaded them at first. The Spanish had no idea that chile will soon take over the world by storm. Ají, the Taíno word for chile is still used today in the Caribbean. In January 15 of 1942, he wrote in his personal log about the island of Hispaniola: ``There is also plenty of ají, which is their pepper, which is more valuable than [black] pepper, and all the people eat nothing else, it being very wholesome. Fifty caravels might be annually loaded with it.'' \autocites[11]{turner_spice_2004}. For the story, I recommend \textcite{wright_medieval_2007}'s \textit{The Medieval Spice Trade and the Diffusion of the Chile}, and for the history of chile in a Chinese context, there is a great new monograph by \textcite[]{dott_chile_2020}.

% Dalby 150:
% One of the things that Columbus particularly wished to do was to find pepper - not quite the most expensive spice in medieval Europe, but the one in most demand. He and his followers came to call the capsicum species 'pepper of the Indies'. 




% Turner 11:
% Peter Martyr, the Italian humanist at the Spanish court, noted that five grains of the new plant brought back by Columbus were hotter and more flavorful than twenty grains of Malabar pepper. Columbus himself was taken aback by its heat, reporting to the king and queen (like many an unwary newcomer since) that he found Caribbean food “extremely hot.” The natives seemed to put their pepper into everything.
%  Not even such a dreamer as Columbus could have foreseen the future success of his aji: It was, of course, the chili, and it was growing wild all over Spain’s new possessions. Within decades the plant had spread so rapidly around the world that Europeans traveling in Asia expressed confusion as to its origin,

Regarding the Chinese names of the chili pepper, there is nothing for me to say that was not already published much more eloquently by \textcite[]{dott_chile_2020}, in his \textit{The Chile Pepper in China: A Cultural Biography}.

% The chile was probably introduced shortly after this, perhaps in the 1520s, for “by 1542, three separate varieties of chilli were growing in India, mainly on the west coast and especially in Goa. Chillis first became well known in Bombay under the name Gowai mirchi (Goan pepper). According to Clusius in his Exoticorum (1605), the chilli pepper was also cultivated in India under the name Pernambuco [a Brazilian port city] pepper.”15


% Exactly when each of these introductions occurred is difficult to pinpoint. As mentioned above, gazetteers are generally an excellent source for tracing the introduction of other new crops. However, as is evidenced in the large lag in the record between the earliest source to mention the chile (1591) and the first appearance in a gazetteer (1671), gazetteers are not a particularly reliable source for Map 1.2 Dates of the earliest texts with chiles by province.
