In Chinese, the word for `pepper' is \textit{jiao}. And just like in English, \textit{jiao} now can refer to all the three major sources of pepper. So which pepper is it? It would be safe to assume that \textit{jiao} originally referred to indigenous Chinese peppers of various \textit{Zanthoxylum} species, or Sichuan peppers as we today call them. We can find instances of Old Chinese texts featuring the pepper plant, \textit{jiao} and its branches appear in a poem from the \gls{Shijing}:

% \poemtitle{Mathematics}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The clusters of the pepper plant,}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
椒聊之實、蕃衍盈升。\\
彼其之子、碩大無朋。\\
椒聊且、~~~~~~遠條且。\\!
The clusters of the pepper plant,\\
Large and luxuriant, would fill a pint.\\
That hero there\\
Is large and peerless.\\
O the pepper plant!\\
How its shoots extend!\\
\end{verse}
\attrib{Translated by James Legge, \\
from the \gls{Shijing}}

With the development of words' tendency of being monosyllabic in Old Chinese towards disyllabic words, and with the possible confusion with black pepper, \textit{jiao} later became conventionalized as \textit{huajiao} when referring to the fruits of Sichuan peppers.
