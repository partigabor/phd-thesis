% English,nutmeg
% Middle English,notmyg; nutemug(g)e
% Anglo-Norman,*nois mugue
% Old French,nois mug(u)ede; nois musguete
% Romance,*nuce muscāta
% Latin,nux muscada
% Pahlavi,*mušk
% Sanskrit,muṣka

% EE:
% XIV. ME. nute-, notemug(g)e, later notmyg (XV), note-, nutmeg (XVI), partial tr. of AN. *nois mugue, for OF. nois mug(u)ede (also musguete; now noix muscade) :- Rom *nuce muscāta ‘musk-smelling nut’ (L. nux NUT, muscus MUSK).

% OE:
% "hard aromatic seed of the fruit of a tree found in the East Indies," used as a spice on cookery, c. 1300, note-mug, from Old North French or Anglo-French *noiz mugue, from Old French nois muguete, an unexplained alteration of nois muscade "nut smelling like musk," from nois "nut" (from Latin nux, from PIE *kneu- "nut;" see nucleus) + Latin muscada, fem. of muscat "musky" (see muscat). Probably influenced in English by Medieval Latin nux maga (compare unaltered Dutch muskaatnoot, German muscatnuß, Swedish muskotnöt).

% American English colloquial wooden nutmeg "anything false or fraudulent" is from 1827; Connecticut is called the Nutmeg State "in allusion to the story that wooden nutmegs are there manufactured for exportation." [John Russell Bartlett, "Dictionary of Americanisms," 1859]

%     At a dinner party, the other day, during a little playful discussion of Yankee character, a bland and benevolent-looking old gentleman at my side informed me that he had come to the conclusion that the wooden-nutmeg story was neither more nor less than a mischievous satire. "For," said he, "there would be such an amount of minute carving required to make a successful imitation of the nutmeg, that the deception would hardly pay the workman. For myself, I do not believe the cheat was ever practised." I thanked him in the name of my country for the justice done her, and assured him that the story of the Yankee having whittled a large lot of unsaleable shoe-pegs into melon seeds, and sold them to the Canadians, was also a base fabrication of our enemies. [Grace Greenwood, "Haps and Mishaps of a Tour in Europe in 1853"]

% MW:
%Middle English notemuge, partial translation, partial modification of Old French nois muguete, nois muguede nutmeg, alteration of nois muscade, from Old Provençal noz muscada, from noz nut (from Latin nuc-, nux) + muscada, feminine of muscat musky — more at nut, muscat
%First Known Use: 15th century (sense 1a)

% AH:
% [Middle English notemuge, probably ultimately from Old French nois mugede, alteration of nois muscade, nut smelling like musk, from Old Provençal notz muscada : notz, nut (from Latin nux, nuc-, nut) + muscada, smelling like musk (from musc, musk, from Late Latin muscus; see MUSK). N., sense 4 and v., perhaps from earlier slang nutmegs, testicles, or current slang nuts, testicles (since the nutmegged ball passes between the defender's legs) or perhaps from rhyming slang nutmeg, leg.]

% WK:
% From Middle English notemege, notemuge, a partial translation of Medieval Latin nux muga, a variant of Medieval Latin nux muscata (“musky nut”). Compare also Old French nois mugede.

%"spice made from dry outer husk of nutmeg," late 14c., from Old French macis (in English taken as a plural and stripped of its -s), a word of uncertain origin, sometimes said to be a scribal error for Latin macir, the name of a red spicy bark from India, but OED finds this etymology unlikely.
