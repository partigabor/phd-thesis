\lettrine[lines=\iniciale]{\textcolor{\accentcolor}{N}}{ow} that the detailed explanation of the diffusion of spices is complete, let us examine spice names. Throughout this chapter, I will look at the terminology comparatively, using three sets of names representing spice nomenclature in English, Arabic, and Chinese. This chapter constitutes the results and findings of the analysis on the terms of the spice domain, from linguistic-cognitive perspectives. 

I will start with an overview of the data and the results in numbers, and then I will thematically introduce certain aspects of the terminology, guiding the reader from a general questions of analyzability and structure, towards more nuanced probes that will shed light on the composition, rationale, and motivations behind spice names. The aim of this section is to have an understanding of how spice names are formed, what are the components of typical spice names, and why languages use these elements. At the end of this chapter, a close look into the names of one specific spice will show how can we apply the findings. 

\section{Overview: Spice Names in Numbers}
% Figures and Statistics

  \label{fig:languages_pie}
\end{wrapfigure}

As a result of the data collection set forth in \cref{ch:data}, the spice name dataset now contains 365 spice names. Of these, 157 are in English, 86 are in Arabic, and 122 are in Chinese; \cref{fig:languages_pie} shows this distribution.
The total number is the result of the lengthy process of carefully compiling the nomenclature for the set of spices as defined at the beginning of the thesis, which consists of 24 different spices. The data collection methods were detailed in \cref{sec:data_collection}. Combing through dictionaries and the literature, it quickly became clear that the accumulation of spice names---and therefore this project is essentially endless---there is no feasible way to compile the infinite aromatic plant products of the world, and certainly not their many names. This can spark both stress and joy; on the one hand I am relieved that I chose only two dozen relatively well known spices and not more, while on the other I am excited to see that there is room to grow: there are more aromatics to include, more names to examine, and more things to learn.
 
On average, a spice in my dataset has 14 names, where the max is 44 (chile), and the min is 4 (fenugreek and mace). \Cref{fig:ids_top_and_bottom_ann} shows the top ten and the bottom ten spices that have the most and least number of names, including all three languages. The legitimacy of this figure might raise some eyebrows, but in fact it is a very good indicator of which spices are more complicated in their nomenclature overall, and therefore which are the most \textit{problematic} to untangle. As we can see, spice plants that boast with many names include the chili pepper, Sichuan pepper, cassia and false cardamoms, which represent spices that are rich in variety. On the other hand there is also allspice, which has no variety at all but a confusing and unclear set of names across the three languages. These are---not incidentally---the very items that I have dedicated substantially more pages to than some of their peer spices, due to issues about their identity or the complexity and richness of their nomenclature. This seems to go hand in hand with matters of biodiversity: chile has countless varieties that have spread to faraway corners of the earth, and now it is a hobby in its own right to cultivate, breed, and crossbreed hot chile cultivars. As we saw, Sichuan pepper species are used across vast regions in East Asia (mainly in China), and it can cause headache to pin them down exactly, their ``boundaries'' and varieties are not that well defined---especially to those outside East Asia---and it does need some explanation to untangle and isolate the various sources of cassia types as well.

	\label{fig:ids_tripie}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, spices with the lowest number of names are presumably the most straightforward items, take for example cloves, or vanilla. But what makes a spice ``straightforward'', or in other words, simple? In my opinion, it is their uniqueness and recognizability. Indeed, if we reflect on our investigation on vanilla in the last section of the data chapter, we have already established that it is a rather special item: there is no other spice that is made from the fruits of an orchid, no other spice that is obtained from crystals of long dark brown beans, and no other spice that is sold in liquid form---it is unique. Or, if we think of cloves, they are unmistakable in their shape and in many language they are known by their shape (see \ref{ety:clove}). These two items are also very well circumscribed in terms of their geographic origins. Although now cultivated in multiple tropical regions, vanilla is known to be from the jungles of Central America and Brazil, there is no doubt about its origins. The native habitat of cloves is even more narrow, as it is only indigenous only to North Maluku and the ``spice islands'' of Makian, Ternate, and Tidore. We see nutmeg and mace as well among the bottom five items with the least amount of names, and we should notice that nutmeg and its mace are also from this region, they were exclusively found on the Banda islands of Maluku, and nowhere else until the second half of the \nth{18} century. Now, it makes a bit more sense to look at these same charts deconstructed by language, this can be seen on \cref{fig:ids_tripie}. The most conspicuous feature of these pie charts is that chili has the most names, across every language.



\section{The Analysis of Spice Nomenclature}
\label{sec:analysis}

This section will now present the analysis on spice names trying to answer the main question: How do people name spices, and specifically, new spices that they came into contact with? Immediately, we can think of two ways: languages either borrow, or conceive a name. We saw the borrowed element in the previous chapter, and now we will dive into how the naming process exactly works. What are the  structural requirements and salient features that influence the creation of a name? How languages invent and generate new names for novel materials and substances? In an attempt to give answers to these questions, I took a bottom-up approach and looked at all 365 names of the 24 spices from the data I collected to arrive to some conclusions. 

So what kind of spice names there are? How does a typical spice name looks like? Intuitively, we can identify two core types of names instantaneously along the lines of their structure: \textit{basic, modified}. \textit{Basic} would be a monomorphemic or a derived word that refers to a prototype spice, without any distinguishing word, e.g., \textit{cardamom}. \textit{Modified} could refer to compounds and noun phrases that use a spice name as a headword, but also have a modifier for purposes of identification and disambiguation, e.g., \textit{green cardamom}, \textit{black cardamom}, \textit{true cardamom}, \textit{false cardamom}, \textit{Nepal cardamom}, \textit{Ethiopian cardamom}, \textit{round cardamom}, \textit{lesser cardamom}, \textit{greater cardamom}, \textit{hill cardamom}, etc. We can also discern the wide range of categories of the modifiers referring to color, shape, size, geographic origin, and even positive and negative evaluations of perceived authenticity. A spice term can also have a modifying word to specify the plant part as well, this can be observed most commonly for spices that are known also as plants, or other parts of the plant are used as well, or the same part is used in other form (i.e. ground or powdered). In English this is usually attached after the headword, similarly to a regular suffix. Examples include: \textit{cumin seed}, \textit{coriander-seed}, \textit{aniseed}, \textit{ginger root}, etc. After consulting intuition, let us consider a more formal analysis.

\subsection{Analyzability and Structure}

Analyzability of words is originally an idea from the \nth{20}-century philological movement and method \textit{Wörter und Sachen} (words and things in German), which had a big influence on linguistics and ethnography. Outlined by Hugo Schuchardt and based on the titular journal \textit{Wörter und Sachen} started by Indo-Europeanist Rudolf Meringer in 1909, it proposed the close study of the etymology of words together with the artifacts/concepts \autocite{ortutay_magyar_1977}. Meringer wrote in 1906: ``Ohne Sachwissenschaft keine Sprachwissenschaft mehr!'' (There is no more linguistics without the study of material culture!). Practically speaking, analyzability meant that the more opaque a name is in terms of morphological analysis, the longer it is assumed to be present in the language. A basic example would be \textit{York} (monomorphemic) vs. \textit{New York} (analyzable), which provides a potential chronology for the concepts the words signify. This approach was incorporated into historical linguistic research and philology, often studied in parallel with findings in archeology \autocite{ortutay_magyar_1977}.

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Analyzability of words in the spice name dataset.}
  \label{table:analyzability}
  \end{table}

\textcite[12]{haspelmath_loanwords_2009} also used the term ``analyzability'' in the creation of their loanword database (\gls{WOLD}) as a first step to assess a word's loanword status, although in a purely linguistic way. I have applied a simplified version of this annotation, and indicated if a word was (1) unanalyzable, (2) semi-analyzable, (3) or analyzable. Items are semi-analyzable if the situation is morphosyntactically complex. For example in case of ``cranberry words'' such as \textit{fenugreek}, where an English speaker could decipher the element \textit{Greek}, but would be left in the dark with \textit{fenu-}, or the Arabicized loanwords from Persian, \textit{dārṣīnī} `cinnamon' or \textit{dārfilfil} `long pepper', where both \textit{ṣīnī} `Chinese' and \textit{filfil} `pepper' would be understood, but Arabic speakers would not know what to do with \textit{dār} (which coincidentally means `house' in Arabic, but it is from Persian `wood'). A Chinese example could be \textit{huluba} `fenugreek', where \textit{hu} `barbarian' is the same character that is found in \textit{hujiao} `black pepper', pointing to its foreign origins, but the whole word itself would be difficult to decode since it is in part a phono-semantic matching or Arabic \textit{ḥulba} `fenugreek'. Sometimes the Chinese term uses the first character 葫, which is a phono-semantic compound of \textit{hu} `barbarian' (after its sound value) and \textit{cao} `herb' for its meaning, making the loanword origin more obvious. 

Analyzability of words greatly interlinks with their structure, which can be simple or monomorphemic (e.g. \textit{hing}), compound (e.g., \textit{stinking gum}), or phrasal (e.g., \textit{devil's dung}). \textit{Asafoetida} would be considered a compound to those only who are familiar with either Latin, or the history and meaning of this word. Even if we are, \textit{asa} is a cranberry morpheme, and \textit{foetida} `fetida' might not be immediately obvious, so it is a semi-analyzable compund. 

Importantly, compounds that are coined within a language are not considered loanwords, even if they contain borrowed elements. Thus, while \textit{chili} is considered a loanword, \textit{chili pepper} is not. Of course, there are always ambiguous cases: is \textit{black pepper} a loanword? It depends on if it is a learned loan/semantic translation from Latin \textit{piper nigrum}, or a genuine English invention; and for this we have to dig deep into the history of words. To sum up, we could say that if a word is morphosyntactically complex, ``it was almost certain that it was created by speakers of the language rather than borrowed from some other language'' \autocite[12]{haspelmath_loanwords_2009}. 

Words that are analyzable are most often compound in their structure, but there are a few derived names as well. As English is an isolating language, it is less comon to find derived words. Derived terms do occur in Arabic, where a handful of spice names come from verbal roots originally referring to the method of acquisition, such as \textit{qirfa} `cinnamon' from \textit{qarafa} `to peel, derind', or \textit{salīkha} `cassia' from \textit{salakha} `to pull off, strip off; skin, flay'. Other methods of word formation for generating spice names in Arabic include the diminutive pattern, cf. the form \textit{fulayfila} from \textit{fulful} `pepper', equivalent to `capsicum'. Or, the pattern to form an active participle in the feminine as it has been proposed in case of \textit{fāghira} `Sichuan pepper' from \textit{faghara} `to open', alluding to the half open, mouth-like pericarps of \taxon{Zanthozylum} species. There a few examples of phrasal names as well, such as the abovementioned \textit{devil's dung}, but most often these tend to be titles of praise rather than  actual names, for example \textit{king of spices} `black pepper', \textit{queen of spices} `cardamom', \textit{red gold} `saffron', etc. \Cref{table:analyzability} and \cref{fig:analyzability_tripie} show the trilingual distribution on the analyzability of words. Closely related to analyzability, is the question if a term is borrowed or not, which I have already covered in the previous chapter on the diffusion of spice words.

  \end{figure}



\subsection{Spice Term Anatomy: Prototypes and Distinguishing Words}

I already mentioned that the vast majority of analyzable spice terms are compounds, and so let us look at the anatomy of these compounds. By far, most compounds are made up of two elements, sometimes three, but even more is possible. Based on the principle of analyzability explained above we could rightfully assume that the more elements a compound name has, the more culturally \textit{distant} it is, the more unfamiliar its referent is to the speakers of the language. We saw in \cref{ch:diffusion} that the earliest attested words are indeed \textit{short} and monomorphemic in their form, such as \textit{dill}, \textit{fulful} `pepper' and \textit{gui} `cassia'. And in support of this theory we also saw that recently attested words are likely to be polymorphemic compounds, such as \textit{Sichuan pepper}, \textit{fulful ifranjī} `allspice', and \textit{xilanrougui} `cinnamon'. In short, there is an obvious tendency from spimple towards the complex.

Every compound element has a headword, and one (or more) modifier(s). Take for instance \textit{sweet cumin} referring to `anise', where the headword is \textit{cumin}, and the modifier is \textit{sweet}. The use of \textit{cumin} can be explained by the prototype theory; to the person(s) who coined this term, cumin was an already known, ideal prototype for anise, on account of their similarity in their appearance (indeed, the two kinds of seeds look very similar, and they are related plants from roughly similar geographical origins to an English speaker). And so here, we can determine that the rationale for use of the headword is `prototype similarity' with the basis of physical appearance. In most cases, the motivation behind the creation of spice names is simply identification and disambiguation.\footnote{Another interesting type of motivation is promotion/advertisement, as in the case of \textit{grains of paradise}, where the creation of the name was intended to make the spice more desireable for European buyers. Cf. \textit{xiangcao} `fragrant-grass/herb'} Thus, a distinguishing word is needed to differentiate from the \textit{original} cumin, and this word here is \textit{sweet}. The distinguishing words or modifiers often arise from the most salient quality of the materials when compared to the the prototype item: in this case, the sweetness of anise.

The final thing to point out in this example is that \textit{sweet cumin} is not merely an alternative name of anise, it is an \textit{alias}. Under ``alias'', I am referring to the misleading quality of this name, and I would like to emphasize that the prototype words could be used in two ways: matching or not matching. For example: in the compound \textit{white pepper}, the headword \textit{pepper} is used a matching prototype because the referent of the prototype matches the referant of the whole compound (i.e. white pepper is really pepper). Hence, white pepper is an alternative name which has the role of narrowing, specifying the subtype of pepper in certain situations.Contrastingly, \textit{Jamaica pepper} is an alias, because in the real world the referent of the prototype and the referant of the compound do not match. In these cases, the protoype is used as a headword on account of its similarity---whether physical, chemical, or other.

This difference in how prototypes fill the role of the headword (matching or not) can have serious real world implications, and it is the one single feature of spice names that can cause the biggest confusion. If I may share a personal anecdote. One of my very close friends is working in the family business of importing and exporting various nuts and oil seeds. When a customer ordered a large shipment of black cumin, her boss---her sister---mistakenly ordered cumin. Now, if my friends sister would have glanced on the report my friend made, she would have noticed immediately that black cumin (also known as nigella, \taxon{Nigella sativa}) and cumin (\taxon{Cuminum cyminum}) are two different spices, from different families. The mistake cost a lot to the company, and a lesson was learned, but we can safely assume that this kind of mixup happens regularly. To be clear, I do not want to ``fix'' the usage of common names in this thesis, I am simply trying to explore and explain why there is confusion between certain materials, so that I can organize and present it in a way that it one day might be useful as a trustworthy checklist or master list of spice names. Right now, I still believe that botanical names are the safest way avoid accidents like this. 

By the way, to make things much worse, there are more than one spices that can be called \textit{black cumin} besides nigella, \taxon{Bunium bulbocastanum} (a.k.a. great pignut), and especially \taxon{Elwendia persica} (black seed, black cumin, black caraway) is often confused with the black seeds of nigella. It is not uncommon for a name to be used for the products of several different aromatic plants, and this is a source of confusion.

\subsubsection{Headwords and Prototypes}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{imgs/plots/headword_bar.pdf}
  \caption{Top 5 headwords appearing in spice names, by language.}
  \label{fig:headword_bar}
\end{figure}

When it comes to frequent headwords, we will most often find spice name prototypes---both matching and not matching the referent of the whole compound---for example, the prototype words for pepper, cardamom, cinnamon, and fennel occur in high numbers. The top most frequent headwords can be seen on \cref{fig:headword_bar}. There are also headwords that do not refer to spices, but rather signify other plant parts and products, such as Arabic \textit{jawz} `nut' (with the pimary sense of `walnut' but by extension any nut) as in \textit{jawz al-ṭīb} [nut-of.fragrance] `nutmeg'. Arguably the most salient feature of the nutmeg is its nut-like appearance, and English also testifies to this. Another example could be the words for gum, referring to the useful part of the ferula plant, asafoetida. Headwords that allude to the function, role, and usage of the substances are also present, consider the \textit{spice} in \textit{allspice}, \textit{bahār} `spice' in \textit{bahār ḥulw}	[sweet-spice] `allspice', or \textit{huixiang} [Muslim-spice] `fennel' or \textit{dingxiang} [nail-spice] `clove'.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{imgs/plots/headword_type_tripie.pdf}
  \caption{}
  \label{fig:headword_type_tripie}
\end{figure}


To have an outlook on the full extent of how headwords operate, I have tried to categorize them. According to the usage, most headwords are prototype words used because they are similar to the item that bears he name, followed by cases when the protoytpeis used matchingly. The rest are a few cases that utilize words of plant parts, function, taste, shape, and color in their headwords as most salient elements.




\subsubsection{Modifiers and Distinguishing Words}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{imgs/plots/modifier_bar.pdf}
  \caption{Top 5 modifiers appearing in spice names, by language.}
  \label{fig:modifier_bar}
\end{figure}

When it comes to modifiers, we can see that the most prominent distinguishing words are adjectives of color, taste, size, shape, but unmistakably, modifiers pointing to geographical origins. Names of countries, regions, cities, perceived or real sources of spices are the most prevalent category here. \Cref{fig:modifier_bar} show the top five modifyers across the three languages. 

% Among the top modifiers in English, we can see \textit{Indian} and \textit{Chinese}, 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{imgs/plots/modifier_type_tripie.pdf}
  \caption{Types of modifiers.}
  \label{fig:modifier_type_tripie}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Sensory Words}

Due to the highly stimulating nature of spices, sensory words often frequent the modifiers. In fact, after distinguishing spices by their geographic origin, the second most common types of modifiers are words of color. What are other salient qualities of perception when it comes to spices? It must taste and smell, right? In my analysis, I have identified and categorized sensory words according to the sensory modalities they operate in and the results can be seen in \cref{fig:sensory_tripie}. It is clear that vision---generally accepted as being part of the ``higher senses'' along with hearing---takes the highest ranks, and the ``lower senses'' follow suit: words from the gustatory, olfactory, tactile, and thermal sensory domains. 

% The term málà is a combination of two Chinese characters: "numbing" (麻) and "spicy (piquant)" (辣), referring to the feeling in the mouth after eating the sauce.

% The numbness is caused by Sichuan pepper, which contains hydroxy-alpha-sanshool

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{imgs/plots/sensory_tripie.pdf}
  \caption{}
  \label{fig:sensory_tripie}
\end{figure}


% Besides adjectival modifiers, there is another usual way to compound spice names, with the use of plant parts.


\subsubsection{Summary}

The final question offers itself: What is the most common blueprint for a spice name? According to the statistics of the dataset, the most common combination is \textit{prototype similarity} + \textit{geographical origin}. Therefore, names such as \textit{Indian cardamom}, \textit{Ceylon cinnamon}, and \textit{Chinese anise} are the most typical examples for naming a spices, where the headwords point to a different item of significant similarity. Therefore, \textit{Jamaica pepper}, the first example we mentioned many pages ago in the introduction, is a fairly regular spice name.

\section{Spice Name Analysis: The Case of Star Anise}
\label{sec:case_star_anise}

Let us consider the nomenclature of star anise in the three languages (see \cref{table:names_star_anise}). In English, there is the default term \textit{star anise}, which is a native invention, obviously after the fruit's unmistakable appearance. On a rare occasion, we have information on the exact time of star anise's arrival to England, which is dated to 1588, as it was introduced in \cref{sec:star_anise}. The same inspiration for a name is found in most European languages, either influenced by 16-\nth{17}-century spice dealer terminology, or devised on their own conviction, looking at its recognizable shape. I used the word ``native'', even though the phrase is obviously mixed from an etymological point of view: \textit{anise} is a loanword ultimately from Greek. However, when faced with this type of phrases, I consider that at the time of the contact situation, \textit{anise} was already part of the English lexicon --- as well as \textit{star} --- therefore, this phrase was coined within English, and deemed as a native creation. This practice is consistent with the approach took by the team of \textcite{wold} at \gls{WOLD}. English also has the term \textit{Chinese anise}, which is a phrase consisting of \textit{anise}, again, and \textit{Chinese}, referring to star anise's geographical location and the origin of its procurement for the English. The motivation behind this term could be due to the need to differentiate between Chinese and Japanese star anise, two very similar items. Both phrases utilize the term \textit{anise}, which refers to the small anise seeds of the Mediterranean, used as a spice, and flavouring for liqueurs and confectionary (see \cref{sec:anise}). Why is there a connection to anise? The two plants could not be more different, they are geographically distant, they are botanically unrelated. The only thing that connects them is their highly similar flavor profile, dominated by the volatile oil anethole, the same nauseating and sweet chemical compound that is found in fennel and licorice. And so, for the Europeans who were familiar with anise and its taste, the novel product reminded them of anise's aroma. Hence, the names are in part inspired by taste/plant chemistry, defining anise as a prototype spice and protoype term. To avoid confusion, (the existence of which will be clear to anyone who tries to do a brief search about anise or star anise), distinguishing words are used for the new material. These modifiers are attached to the head word, and in one case inspired by the spice's shape, on the other hand referring to its geopgraphical origin. The existence of a Chinese star anise could be explained by the fact that there is a Japanese star anise as well, a similar looking but poisonous fruit and tree, \taxon{Illicium anisatum}. In short, the two phrases have different ways to identify this spice. English also has a now archaic form referring to star anise: \textit{badian} from French, which arrived via a land route through Persian, perhaps a phonetic loan from Chinese, but there is no documentary evidence for this (see Etymology \ref{ety:badian}).

Arabic \textit{yansūn najmī} [star anise] was devised along similar lines, using a native Arabic word for `star', the prototype word is anise, and the more interesting instances are to be found in neighboring Persian. \textit{Bādyān khatā'ī} or \textit{khatāyī} [star anise] is star anise, while \textit{bādyān rūmī} [Roman anise] is anise.\footcite[Vol. 1, p. 197]{hayyim_new_1934} \textit{Bādyān} alone could also refer to fennel.\footcite[140]{steingass_comprehensive_1892} This shows, that in Persian, the prototype word was \textit{bādyān}. 

As for Chinese, we do not find any loanword among the terms used to refer to star anise, all names are local ``inventions''. The modern ``proper name'' for star anise is \textit{bājiǎohuíxiāng} [eight-horn-hui-spice], where [eight-horn] means `octagonal', and [hui-spice] is fennel, therefore it can be translated as `octagonal fennel', or `eight-horned fennel'. An other name, \textit{dàhuíxiāng} `big-fennel' strengthens the assumption that in Chinese, \textit{huíxiāng} `fennel' is the prototype. Again, the flavor profiles of fennel and anise are basically identical, hence the connection (and confusio). The formal Chinese names of star anise are not attested in historical corpora as we discussed in \cref{sec:star_anise}, and I assume that the vernacular name of \textit{bājiǎo} [eight-horn] was first applied to star anise, and the formal name was modelled later driven by the plant sciences. In modern dialects star anise is also referred to as \textit{huíxiāng} `hui-spice' (historically `fennel') and \textit{dàxiāng} `big-spice'. In modern \gls{TCM}, fennel is referred to as \textit{xiǎohuíxiāng} `little-hui-spice', contrasting the two spices that are confounded due to their taste, using size. In fact, the Chinese \tc{大/小} \textit{dà/xiǎ} `greater/lesser' contrast is not necessarily a marker of size, but a semantic tool to convey unmarked/marked, or proper/imitator.

Not similar 'unmarked' interpretation also show up in English morphosemantics in a different context (e.g. length, width)...Even though 大/小 is typically translated as greater/lesser, it is somewhat misleading. Trandiationally, 大 is use more often, such as in almost all dynastic names,  大秦/大漢/大唐 . These are simply 秦/漢/唐 without 'lesser'-x in contrast. They are simply indicating an unmarked = 'the proper' meaning. 小登科 little_NameAnnounced is not real 登科 NameAnnounced "success in testing to be imperial official", but 'getting married'.  Modern Mandarin rarely uses this contrastive 大 to undeliner (un)markedness but uses 小， e.g. 小東京 小台北 小巨蛋 小聯合國  they typically to 'something that aspires to be x (and is not a real x). And occasionally both terms are used in contrast, such as 
% 大米 rice 小米 millet; 大年夜 new year's eve 小年夜  the night before new year's eve, 大月氏/小月氏 differentiate the Yuezhi proper (where they have their own kingdom) and 'lesser' (the remaining population that was conquered)

To summarize the points I intended to make above: First, I determined if the words and phrases are analyzable (morphologically, syntactically, semantically), then I examined those names further, while also stating why a specific item is unanalyzable. E.g., \textit{badian} as a loanword does not carry any useful information for an English speaker that is not familiar with the word, it cannot be dissected or interpreted alone. Next, I looked at the borrowed status of the names to determine if the word or phrase is borrowed, or devised locally. E.g., the Chinese names are native ``lexical creations'', while English and Arabic use a non-native headword (\textit{anise/yansūn}) and a native distinguishing word (\textit{star/najmī}). Finally, I have looked at the inspirations behind these lexical inventions, and identified the rationale and motivation behind them. For phrases and compound words, we can separate a prototype word (headword), and a distinguishing word (modifier). In each case, we can discern the reasons why that prototype word was used, what feature of the prototype item (referent) is the most salient. The same is true for the distinguishing word(s). For example, \textit{star anise} is named so after (1) similarity in taste + (2) shape; and \textit{Chinese star anise} is named so after (1) similarity in taste + (2) shape + (3) geographic origin. In \cref{table:analysis_star_anise}, you can see a concise overview of the analysis of star anise terminology.

In this sense, the space names are layered. Intuitively, the more layers a spice name has, the more distant the item was culturally, and on the converse, the less components there is to a term, more familiarity with the substance is presumed (e.g., anise vs. star anise in English). Therefore, spice names' modifiers can be categorized according to what salient feature contributed to the naming the most, and in this specific case, it is star anise's distinct shape. As we will later see, shape is just one of many properties that can distinguish/identify a spice, for others, different properties are salient, including color, taste, smell, and the geographical origin we mentioned. Furthermore, these names reflect on the materials' physical qualities, and the perception and importance of a spice for various sensory modalities in the human experience: vision, gustation, olfaction, etc. 






% Trivially, the more similar some spices are, the more confusing their nomenclature will get. The best example for this are the spices from the umbel family: cumin, caraway, anise, fennel, dill, and so on; little seed-like fruits that grow from the Mediterranean to Central Asia. The fascinating connections are most visible when examining them in multiple languages. % EXAMPLES 

% According to the \gls{WN}, there are four senses to the noun \textit{pepper}. Two refers to \textit{Capsicums}, and two to ``true peppers''. Pepper\#1 in the plant lexical file, with synonyms of common pepper\#1, black pepper\#1, white pepper\#1, Madagascar pepper\#1, and Piper nigrum\#1 is defined as ``climber having dark red berries (peppercorns) when fully ripe; southern India and Sri Lanka; naturalized in northern Burma and Assam''. Its hyponym is pepper\#3, synonym of peppercorn\#1, with the definition ``pungent seasoning from the berry of the common pepper plant of East India; use whole or ground'', now we are in the food lexical file. This latter, has two hyponyms on its own: black pepper\#2 (``pepper that is ground from whole peppercorns with husks on'') and white pepper\#2 (``pepper ground from husked peppercorns'')

% How to accommodate for the confusion in the past, semantic changes kurkum, saffron? They appear twice in both relevant categories!

% Just a quick question:
% I couldn't not notice that the character used for fennel and anise 茴 huí is made up of the radical for "grass" and 回 huí which is used for Islam and Muslims in Tang dynasty times. My question is: Could this be a construction that would refer to fennel (or anise) as "Muslim grass", "Muslim herb", since the plant came to China from the West originally (East Mediterranean, Middle East), and most likely through Muslim traders of Central Asia?
% Or this is not how Chinese characters work, and it is just my fantasy running wild and 回 huí is just a sound component...

% Thank you for the answer, I am working on the Tastes of Words article hastily now, I should be done very soon.



% Yes, good observation!  I suspected so too, but could not find direct supporting evidence yet.

% Good indirect evidences, other than your observation, are 
% >that 茴 is not found in Shuowenjiezi, which means that it is a later coinage and most likely borrowing; and in this case, 香 standing for herb in a compound and the first character will typically specify its origin (if borrowed), or plant, or sound
% >the earliest documented usage we can see now of this term is after Tang dynasty (supporting the borrowing hypothesis and consistent with the time of introduction of this herb to China)
% >The only document I found claims that it is derived from 蘾 from SWJZ characters due to phonological similarity. But this is an apparent 'backformation' speculation as 1) the phonology is distinctive enough (huai2 in Mandardin), and 2) it is a kind of watergrass in SWJZ, and definitely no fennel (and of course we do know now that China did not have fennel during SWJZ time)

\section{The Language of Spices: The Case of Pepper}

One of the most globally and cross-linguistically recognizable words of the spice domain is \textit{pepper}. In the \gls{WOLD}, it is ranked no. \nth{7} when sorted by borrowability, following behind the olive, the sugar, the wine, the kettle, the beer, and the cheese, in the semantic field of food and drink \autocite{wold}. Pepper has a score of 0.66, making it the top spice meaning in this dataset of 81 entries (and the only spice besides the chili pepper). This metric, ``borrowed score'', is an average of the scores of all the words that correspond to the meaning `pepper', where individual meanings are scored according to their borrowed status.\footnote{The values assigned are determined as the following: clearly borrowed: 1.00, probably borrowed: 0.75, perhaps borrowed: 0.50, very little evidence for borrowing: 0.25, and no evidence for borrowing: 0.00. See more at \url{https://wold.clld.org/terms}} ``Thus, the higher the average borrowed score of a meaning, the greater its borrowability.'' -- it is explained on the database's website. This suggests that if we were to collect the words for pepper in different languages and project them onto a world map, we should be able to see clusters that indicate the donor languages, and that gather around key areas of the globe that were important in the diffusion of this spice and \gls{wanderwort}. This in turn, would highlight the cultures and locations that were responsible for its transfer.

\subsection{The Distribution of Pepper}

Similarly to the analysis we conducted in \cref{ch:diffusion} with cinnamon and the distribution of its names seen in \cref{fig:cinnamon_distribution}, we can also plot the names of pepper onto a world map, and look at how they are dispersed at present. First, I made the choice to collect words that correspond to `pepper', and not compounds that gloss the more specific `black pepper' (or not `chili pepper' for that matter). Then, I have collected the names by scraping the relevant Wiktionary translations\footcite{noauthor_pepper_2022} for the word \textit{pepper} in the sense `spice', (and not in the sense of `fruit of the capsicum'). I then cleaned and manually checked the data for errors, and corrected the list to the best of my ability. Next, I augmented the dataset using other sources, such as dictionary entries, \textcite{katzer_spice_2012}, and the ``the pepper'' meaning page from \gls{WOLD} by \textcite{wold}, which contains 36 entries. Lastly, I have analyzed the words based on their etymologies, and grouped them into categories according to their etymons. After concatenating the collected data with language information and coordinates obtained from the \gls{WALS} and Glottolog datasets, the plot could be generated, and it can be found under \cref{fig:distribution_pepper}

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    \label{fig:distribution_pepper}
\end{figure}

Looking at \cref{fig:distribution_pepper} it becomes immediately evident, that there are a few large, clearly distinguishable groups forming among the scattered data points, each representing a word and a language. The following categories were identified: pippali, pigment, marica, and hujiao. Pippali contains all words that ultimately derive from Sanskrit \textit{pippali} and this means most languages in Europe, including those that were influenced by Latin \textit{piper}, and those that loaned this word through Persian \textit{pilpil} and Arabic \textit{fulful}. The pigment group covers West Iberian Romance languages, where the Latin word for pigment went through a series of changes by way of metonymy and specialization of meaning, explained under \ref{ety:pimento}. The marica groups captures instances that originate in the ``true sense'' for black pepper, Sanskrit \textit{marica}, which is distributed across South, Central, and to a lesser extent Southeast Asia. Lastly, words that belong to the hujiao group are those languages that borrowed their word for black pepper from Chinese, found across the Sinosphere. 
% every group that has at least
% three attested members???
% What's the threshold?
Instances that do not belong to any group or their origins I could not determine were assorted to ``other''. Besides the apparent category of words derived from Sanskrit \textit{pippali} (and spread generously though Persian and Latin), there are other major and minor groups that can be discerned, especially the category of words that derive from Sanskrit \textit{marica}. The piquancy of this ambivalence in the distribution of these two Sanskrit words is elevated by the fact that while \textit{pippali} refers to long pepper (\taxon{Piper longum}), \textit{marica} is the term that originally referred to black pepper (\taxon{Piper nigrum}) --- forming a duo of closely related aromatic plants and spice terms.

Words that derive from \textit{marica} are dispersed throughout South and Central Asia, and Hungarian \textit{bors} is probably the furthest instance geographically from the once Sanskrit heartland and the home of pepper. Hungarian tribes most likely loaned this word from Turkic speaking peoples (with many other words from the domain of commerce and agriculture) on their way to the Carpathian basin sometime before the \nth{9} century.\footnote{Hungarian \textit{bors} was attested in 1075 as a proper noun, 1395 as a common noun. Cf. Ottoman Turkish dialectal \textit{burç}, Chuvash \textit{pərəs} `id.', the Turkic words are from an Iranian language; cf. Sogdian \textit{marč}, Pamirian \textit{märč} `id.' \autocite[90]{zaicz_etimologiai_2006}}



We know for a fact that even in the early times of the Roman republic (510-31 \BC{}), Indian long pepper was imported and used in Europe, but have evidently lost its prominence later on. From the history of this word, we can ascertain that at the time the Greeks borrowed the word for pepper from Aryan merchants, long pepper was definitely traded alongside black pepper. Unfortunately, we are not sure in what ratio they were imported, but they were both knows to ancient writers of Europe. Hippocrates have discussed pepper and its medicinal benefits in the \nth{5} century \BC{}, Theophrastus have distinguished them in his \textit{Historia Plantarum} in the \nth{4} century \BC{}, and explained the difference between the two; stating that long pepper has a stronger flavor. According to \textcite{toussaint-samat_history_2009}, the pepper that the Romans preferred was in fact long pepper, and the round black peppers we now use ``became popular in the \nth{12} century and had replaced long pepper by the \nth{14}''. It is often difficult to know which pepper ancient writers are talking about, because in Latin, both could be referred to simply as \textit{piper} \autocite[442-443]{toussaint-samat_history_2009}. The modern scientific names go back to these early times, \textit{longum} means `long' and \textit{nigrum} means `black'. 

If we rely on historians, it becomes rather trivial that the name \textit{piper} and its other derivatives is a \gls{wanderwort} that have first traveled with the product (the long pepper called \textit{pippali}), and went through a semantic shift later, when black pepper replaced long pepper. The word stayed, but its referent changed. And this change happened alike in many languages in this part of the world, even if the the two kinds of peppers looked different, their flavor profile and functions were the same. This semantic change happened once more in history: when people became acquainted with chilies, the same shift happened, and people started to use their (local) words for the pepper they had, to refer to the red hot chili peppers that conquered the world.

% The situation is also interesting in Thai, where the word for pepper was \tha{พริก} \textit{phrík} `pepper', a Khmer donation from Sanskrit \textit{marica} present for the 12-\nth{14} centuries. However, this term refers to chilies today. The arrival, success, and integration of the New World chilies into Thai culture and cuisine forced people to make a distinction between the old and new peppers, and so the Asian black pepper became known \tha{พริกไทย} \textit{phríkthay} [pepper-Thai], meaning `Thai pepper' \autocite{suthiwan_thai_2009}.

\subsection{The Diffusion of Pepper}

The names of pepper on the above map demonstrate indirect evidence for the trails the material have left, and show the extent of trade networks at certain times. They reveal the cultures and civilizations located at the heartland of the product and the crossroads of its exchange. The distribution of clusters of words belonging to the same categories in this plot also indicate the possible ways of diffusion. This can be then studied from a historical linguistic point of view through investigating language contact and loanwords, reinforced with historical awareness, and supported by botanical information. Domain knowledge of spices is also crucial, if we want to answer specific questions about the spread of spices and spice terminology. For example, one of the reasons pepper (and its name) was so successful on reaching faraway places so early on is due to the fact that pepper does not spoil. Or at least, not fast compared to other agricultural products; it keeps it aroma and pungency longer that many other spices. \textcite[59]{krondl_taste_2007} writes that ``pepper, in particular, is remarkably stable and can be stored up to a decade as long as it’s kept reasonably dry.'' This is one of the key feature of spices, that allowed them to be shipped and carried thousands of miles away, during the course of several months if not years. Moreover, as dried plant matter, spices are also light, resulting in an extremely high price-to-weight ratio compared to, say, wheat, which made trading in pepper so lucrative in the past, and defined the fate (and face) of cities, such as Venice.

Turning our attention back to vocabulary, the most fascinating part of this phenomenon is that the word \textit{pepper} originates so distant from English; both in time and space. Thanks to the hard work of historical linguists and philologists, we have a decent reconstruction of \textit{pepper}'s journey, and we know that Germanic tribes must have loaned the term on mainland Europe, some time before their migration to England around the \nth{5} century. early Old English \textit{pipor} comes from Latin, which originates in the Sanskrit word \textit{pippali} by way of an Indo-Aryan transmission (see \ref{ety:pepper}). The spatial and temporal trajectories of this word are remarkable, and follow the path of the material. Indian pepper (black and long) was known and coveted in Arabia and Rome long before the Anglo-Saxons got to taste it. Still, much of the story of pepper and its worldwide diffusion goes back to prehistoric times. Tracing its itinerary on Eurasian pathways is difficult at this time depth, yet we have breadcrumbs: its names. \textit{Pippali} and its derivatives mark the way the spice have spread, even where written documentation and archaeological finds are missing.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    \label{fig:diffusion_pepper}
\end{figure}

Now, homing in on our scope of English, Arabic, and Chinese, we can look at the etymological stages of the words for pepper in these languages. In \cref{fig:diffusion_pepper}, I tried to illustrate the origins of the words for pepper in the languages under inspection. We see that the branch that leads to English is on the same trajectory as Arabic, both going back to the Sanskrit etymon. They also formed their words for long pepper with the prototype words \textit{pepper} \& \textit{filfil}: English modeled it after Latin, while Arabic loaned a Persian term that compounded `wood' and `pepper' (\textit{dar pilpil}), the reasons behind which we can only speculate. Either it reminded the Persians to a piece of stick, or there was maybe some type of analogy with the name of cinnamon: \textit{dar chini}. Unmistakably, the Chinese did not loan a word for black pepper pepper, they formed their own name by compounding their prototype word, \textit{jiao}, appending it with \textit{hu}, referring to foreigners, Western barbarians. Notwithstanding, Sanskrit \textit{pippali} also survives in Chinese, in the form of \textit{biba}, strictly referring to long pepper, known since ?? and still used in \gls{TCM}. The questions begs to be asked: Why was one pepper adopted with a native word and designation, and why was the other loaned? I can think of two reasons. First, black peppercorns are very similar to the indigenous Sichuan peppers --- in their shape, size, taste, and function --- therefore it seems obvious to apply the term that already exist and conceptually very close to the new material. By way of their similarity, a metaphoric way of expression extended the set of referents for this word, \textit{jiao}. Second, long pepper was a new item not incredibly similar to already existing Chinese products, it would place itself further away from Sichuan pepper in the semantic space. They do not match in color, shape, size, and even in its use long pepper was (and still is) rather a medicine than culinary spice. It was alien enough to be adorned with a loanword.

% “Foreign pepper”. The principal time of import to China was estimated to be during the Tang dynasty, and the source―per the miscellany Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang of the 9th century CE―was the Magadha Kingdom of India, where it was called 昧履支 (MC muʌiH liɪX t͡ɕiᴇ) locally; cf. Sanskrit मरिच (marica, “black pepper”).

The etymologies were introduced in detail under etymologies \ref{ety:pepper}, \ref{ety:fulful}, and \ref{ety:hujiao}.

\subsection{The Role of Pepper in English: A Brief Contemplation About Spiciness}

Now that we have discovered that pepper as a product, and thus \textsc{spice} as a concept was at one point a novelty for the ancestors of English speakers, let us briefly consider life before pepper. We can safely presuppose a time, where pepper --- and therefore experiences of spiciness --- simply did not exist for certain communities. Or did it? Was there some wild garlic growing in Europe whose sharpness in taste could be compared to pepper? Some mustard, or horseradish? How did these people describe spiciness before spice? Or peppery before pepper? 

Sensory experiences of taste, such as sweet, salty, sour, and bitter, are encoded in the mappings of our evolutionary biology, and the same is true for pain. In fact, spiciness is a tactile sensory experience, roughly working along the same mechanisms as our perception of heat and pain. The technical term is chemesthesis, and it is defined as the sensitivity of our mucosal surfaces of the skin (e.g. the moist inner linings of the mouth) to outside chemicals. This system activates thermal, nociceptive (i.e. pain), and tactile sensations \autocite{simons_oral_2008}. Substances such as piperine (in black pepper) and capsaicin (in chile pepper) cause a reaction that activates this system causing a burning, stinging sensation which --- in moderate amounts --- can be a pleasant. These stimuli also contribute to the overall flavor perception of food \autocite{tewksbury_evolutionary_2008}. The first sense of the word \textit{pungent} (now rare) shows well how strong the connection to pain was: ``of pain: as if caused by a sharp point; piercing, stabbing; pricking.'' The definition for the sense that is now generally understood is ``affecting the sense organs, esp. those of smell or taste, with a sharp, penetrating sensation; acrid, irritant; intensely flavored, piquant.'' Words, such as \textit{pungent}, \textit{sharp}, \textit{biting} (also a cognate of \textit{bitter}), and \textit{hot} show that we do not necessarily need the word \textit{spicy} (a loanword), to describe \textsc{spiciness} (i.e. pungency). However, the foreign concept of \textsc{spice} was influential enough to make way for new words and meanings attested in \nth{13} century English. 

%spice, spicy...

Today, spices and their access ability is taken for granted, and the idea of not knowing how ``spicy'' tastes like, is --- for most of us --- unimaginable. The existence and abundance of spices around us, even if one does not prefer the heat on a daily basis, is now part of the human experience. This omnipresence is reflected in our words; spices have become the part of our vocabulary, the way we speak, and not just when we talk about the spices themselves. The following section will show how spices infiltrated our language, and how their characteristic features gave rise to new words and new meanings, metaphors, and idioms. I will examine the profound effect spices made on the lexis, through looking at the case of pepper in English.

\section{\textit{Pepper} as a Lexical Item}

Pepper, and I mean black pepper, is undoubtedly a prototypical spice. In a significant portion of the world's regions --- or at least in the temperate areas --- black pepper was the first pungent spice people have ever tasted. Although black pepper became indeed the first global spice, it is not the only one. Many other regions have their own prototypical pungent spices and relishes; some already famous worldwide, some still relatively unknown. As examples, we must mention the chile of the Americas, the prickly ash of China, the \textit{cabai} of Southeast Asia, and the grains of paradise of West Africa. Now, if I would to list them again in the same order, but this time through a finer/different sieve of English, I could have written: chili pepper, Sichuan pepper, long pepper, and melegueta pepper. Mind you, these are all botanically different aromatic plants, distributed all over the globe, all culturally rooted in their respective regions. Yet in English, all of them can be referred to as some kind of pepper. 

What we have here, is evidence that English speakers, going beyond the primary sense of the term \textit{pepper} (used for the little round fruits of \taxon{Piper nigrum}) have developed the use of this word for ``any of certain other pungent spices derived from plants of other families, esp. ones used as seasonings''\footcite[pepper, n.]{oed}. The meaning of \textit{pepper} was extended by ways of its physical attributes (small, black, seed-like fruits), chemical characteristics (pungency), and role (spice, seasoning, condiment). Hence, other substances that matched or approximated one or more of the above-mentioned features, could be referred to as \textit{pepper}. Often with a distinguishing word, today many plant products are known as peppers: \textit{red}, \textit{pink},  \textit{bell}, \textit{sweet},
\textit{Jamaica}, \textit{alligator}, etc. The list is long and functionally diverse, as distinguishing words and modifiers can have various different roles. They can identify, distinguish, or indicate some aspect of the produce, for example, its place of origin, flavor, or shape. \textit{Pepper}, with the primary meaning referring to the fruits of \taxon{Piper nigrum}, was attested in early Old English, and the extended sense developed shortly after the European ``Age of Exploration'', when the world opened up to the English sailors and merchants, and exotic, new products were brought back from Africa, Asia, and America. A \nth{16}-century quote from a herbal shows this new use of the word \textit{pepper}, and also the attitude towards a novel spice --- Guinea pepper\footnote{An ambiguous name for an African source of ``pepper'', it can refer to one of three different spice yielding plants: \taxon{Aframomum melegueta} (grains of paradise, melegueta pepper, etc.); \taxon{Piper guineense} (West African pepper, Ashanti pepper, etc.); \taxon{Xylopia aethiopica} (Grains of Selim, Senegal pepper, etc.)} --- and simultaneously hints on the status of black pepper: 

\begin{quote}
``Ginnie pepper hath the taste of pepper, but not the power or vertue.'' \\
(Gerard, J. (1597) \textit{Herball} (Vol. 2, p. 293).in \cite[pepper]{oed})
\end{quote}

And so, a \textit{pepper-genesis} started, a rather clumsy term I made up for this phenomenon when Europeans familiarized themselves with new additions from the fruits of the plant kingdom; both to the cargo hold of their ocean-going ships, their apothecaries and grocers, and their vocabularies. Pepper worked as a prototype, and lent its name to other fragrant plant materials that needed to be named,

Beyond this the ability to generate names of all kinds of peppers --- true and false --- there is an even more interesting aspect of the word \textit{pepper} that I would like to discuss: the derivation of new words over various word classes.

We also assume that the more a language is familiar with a substance, more senses could exist in a language, and with this above assumption (4) we look for derivationally related linguistic categories of terms from the spice domain. Under these categories we will include:

the names (nouns)
• names of the sensation induced by the spice (nouns, adjectives)
• synaesthetic properties associated with the spice (adjectives, verbs)
• cognate verbs of seasoning, cooking (verbs)
• denominal metaphors, idiomatic expressions (nouns, verbs, phrases)

% The English compound ‘pep talk’ appeared in colloquial American English in the 20th century, and contains ‘pep’, which is a shortening for pepper, meaning “energy and high spirits; liveliness, vigour, power” (OED). We can see the WordNet mappings showing ‘ginger’ as one of the synonyms for ‘pep’, and consulting a dictionary confirms the evidence of a second spice representing ‘liveliness’: “Spirit, pep, energy; temper. Frequently in to put ginger (into), to show ginger.” (OED), in American slang.


% We suspect that word frequencies in corpora would show their relative importance in a language, hence for example ‘Sichuan pepper’ and its variations34 in an English corpus should have a smaller relative frequency (0.03 per million words), than ‘花椒’ huājiāo (“Sichuan pepper”) in a Chinese corpus (4.6 per million), or \hi{हल्दी} haldī (“turmeric”) in a Hindi corpus should have a very high frequency score (27.29 per million words), which arguably shows the importance of this spice in Indian culture. These are merely examples from the preparatory stage, but similar observations shall be refined and collected in a tasteful and readable manner in the dissertation.
