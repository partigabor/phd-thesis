% Who what why when and how?

\lettrine[lines=\iniciale]{\textcolor{\accentcolor}{R}}{ealizing} that there is little work done on building a spice name database, or on analyzing spice nomenclature from historical and linguistic-cognitive perspectives, I have set out to assemble one that would facilitate this kind of analysis. 
To introduce very briefly, I have built a database of spices and spice terminology by combing through secondary and primary literature, botanical databases, encyclopedias and dictionaries, and searching for the spices in contemporary and historical corpora. I then used a few selected features of these materials (region of origin, spreadability, etc.) and the corresponding terms (borrowed status, word formation, etc.) and looked at the set of spices as a whole, trying to find patterns and make some interesting observations about the diffusion, naming, and other aspects of spices.

% What did you do to achieve the research aims?

\section{Research Design Principles}

To achieve these aims, I first needed think of an ideal way to compile and arrange these very complex pieces of information, data that are highly interdisciplinary in nature. From the very beginning of the design of this study, the following principles were kept in mind regarding the database of spice names: 

(1) The database must be grounded in the close study of the materials---the plants and their products---especially from a historical and botanical standpoint. Awareness of the material's physical journey will help us to contextualize some of the ways the associated names spread. Take for example the Sanskrit term referring to asafoetida (the dried oleoresin gum from \taxon{Ferula assa-foetida} et al.): \sa{हिङ्गु} \textit{hiṅgu}, which is the etymon of both Chinese \zh{興蕖} \textit{xīngqú} (\gls{MC} /hɨŋ ɡɨʌ/),
% \zh{形虞} \textit{xíngyú} (\gls{MC} /ɦeŋ  ŋɨo/)
and English \textit{hing}, but they took very different paths: while the Chinese term is a learned loan from during the spread of Buddhist scriptures on the overland Silk Road, the English word is a late \nth{16}-century borrowing via the sea trade with Mughal India. And if we study the source of the materials and learn about the plants, we will also realize that all the hing that was exported from India in the early modern period was in fact imported from Persia and Afghanistan.

(2) The database must be thoroughly cited; every word, statement, date, or other piece of information should be carefully referenced. I have already explained the motivation and necessity behind this practice in \cref{ch:introduction}, it is enough to say that currently no one is citing sources for the names they give (except philologists), and sometimes it hard to find the motivation and inspiration behind a term. It is always a good scholarly practice to record where we found certain pieces of information, and when it comes to spice etymologies, this should make it easier for experts to verify or refute the findings on a specific item or stage.
% Example?

(3) The database should be easily expandable. Because of the limited time, it is impossible for me to include \emph{every} spice. Therefore, I try to create a pipeline, where a new material and its names can be easily added to the fold, and quickly analyzed. This in principle can also accommodate for the future inclusion of incense, perfume, and herbs, which I will mention in \cref{sec:future_study} when discussing future plans to expand on this research.

\subsection{Identification, Confusion, Adulteration, Clarification}

The ideal first step of all types of research related to spices, herbs, incense, and other aromatics is to identify the product exactly. In the case of spices and incense, this is overwhelmingly a botanical question, while in the case other exotic aromatics, such as musk or ambergris, we must involve the animal kingdom. Medical, pharmaceutical, and food industry studies are heavy on the hard sciences---chemistry, biology---but they sometimes also contain valuable information about both common and scientific names. All medical studies must start with the proper identification of the substance, in fact, there is a range of studies about various techniques on identification and differentiation \autocite[cf.][]{ford_cinnamon_2019}. The reasons for this are twofold. 

Firstly, in many cases it is not a straightforward task to tell the substances apart, different spices can have very similar physical qualities. E.g., the fruits of Chinese star anise (\taxon{Illicium verum}) and Japanese star anise (\taxon{Illicium anisatum}) basically look the same, but the latter is toxic; see the excellent points made by \textcite{small_confusion_1996} on the confusion of their common names. Uncertainty in nomenclature and identity poses a further challenge to clinical trials if the origins of a substance is not properly identified. Take for example \textcite{oketch-rabah_cinnamon_2018}, who writes on the confusion of cinnamon and cassia nomenclature and its implications in pharmaceutical research. Consider first cinnamon (\taxon{Cinnamomum verum} syn. \taxon{C. zeylanicum}). Common names include \textit{true cinnamon} and \textit{Ceylon cinnamon}. However, the cinnamon sold in the US and in the UK markets are generally not the same spice: most of the product labelled as cinnamon on American shelves is in fact cassia (\taxon{Cinnamomum cassia} syn. \taxon{C. aromaticum}) \autocite{oketch-rabah_cinnamon_2018}, which is sometimes called `fake cinnamon' or `bastard cinnamon'. In retrospect, the Latin scientific name of the former makes bit more sense now: \textit{verum} means `real, true, genuine'. But why is cassia fake cinnamon? This is due to historical reasons, from when the introduction of the much cheaper cassia pushed down the cinnamon prices drastically in the \nth{19} century \autocite{wijesekera_chemistry_1978}. Most scholars consistently refer to \taxon{C. zeylanicum} as cinnamon, and to \taxon{C. cassia} as cassia but it is not uncommon in everyday language use to confound the two, especially in referring to cassia as cinnamon, out of innocent ignorance. For more detail and on the identity of cinnamon and cassia please see \cref{sec:identity_cinnamon}. Uncovering confusions from under heaps of synonyms lead us to interesting historical events that sometimes explain the vernacular names of a particular product, such as the case of cinnamon and cassia shows. 

Secondly, adulteration and contamination are rampant in the industry. Saffron (\taxon{Crocus sativus})---the most expensive spice by weight nearing the price of gold---is famous for being knocked up (and substituted) with the much cheaper flowers of safflower (\taxon{Carthamus tinctorius}). Even their names reflect these practices: although the two are very different and unrelated plants, their similar dyeing properties and constant confusion have left its mark. \textit{Safflower} has been influenced by the French word for saffron, even if they have different origins (both ultimately from Arabic). And, on account of the adulteration, safflower have also came to be known as \textit{bastard saffron}, attested in 1548. 

We do not need to lurk modern pharmacological studies to find examples of confusion, the identity of saffron was also elusive in ancient China, where at its introduction in the early Middle Ages, it was confused with safflower, and both were casually called \zh{紅花} \textit{honghua}. It is said that Buddhist monks picked up saffron in Kashmir on their way from India to China, but the knowledge about it was not clear until the Yuan dynasty, when it was actually used and imported \autocite{laufer_sino-iranica_1919}. During Tang times, it was also connected with the---also strongly yellow---turmeric. Turmeric came first, and got the name \zh{鬱金} \textit{yujin} [yü-gold], and later saffron was named \zh{鬱金香} \textit{yujinxiang} [yü-gold-aromatic] \autocite{schafer_golden_1985}. The confusion of saffron and turmeric (and truthfully every other yellow spice used as a dye) is also observable in Classical Arabic, \textit{kurkum} `turmeric', historically also `saffron' (etymon of the word \textit{curcuma}), and the perceived ``similarity'' of Sanskrit \sa{कुङ्कुम} \textit{kuṅkuma} `saffron' did not help to clear the waters either \autocite[see]{guthrie_trade-language_2009}.

Keeping all this in mind, I feel I must lean on rudimentary botanical identification in the investigation, linking the plants and plant parts to the products and their vernacular names. This is important, as it can clear up some of the confusion when two or more products are used interchangeably, and it will highlight problematic cases from the start.



\section{Data Collection}
\label{sec:data_collection}

% I had select a set of spices that will constitute the basis for this project.

The data collection for this project was conducted in three stages. One for assembling the set of spices, one for gathering their names, and one for researching etymologies. The result of these three stages are open for inspection in the electronic files \texttt{spices.csv}, \texttt{names.csv}, and \texttt{etymologies.csv}, available on the corresponding GitHub page. \amarginpar{Where is that?} \Cref{ch:data} will introduce and explain the data in all three levels.

\subsection{Collecting the Spices}

In the first stage, after I have assembled the set of spices, I collected information about them from encyclopedic handbooks written by experts in the plant sciences and spice industry professionals. I have made great use of \textcites{van_wyk_culinary_2014}{peter_handbook_2012}{hu_food_2005} at the start, especially when matching plant products to plants. At this stage, I have focused on the identity and characteristics of spices including geographical distribution and native habitats, especially where I saw any room for confusion. As I collected scientific names, I also recorded the common/vernacular names for each spice as an initial exploration, and I linked them to a botanical database that can supply further information. I have also collected information regarding their basic uses especially in traditional medicine.

Surprisingly, the abundance of synonyms is also palpable in the scientific nomenclature, sometimes one plant species has dozens of binomial \glspl{taxon}. In an attempt towards standardization of taxonomic data, collaborative efforts have sprung across numerous authoritative institutions to assemble and link their respective databases and sources. These online projects are usually run by a consortium of leading botanical institutions worldwide, among the key entities are the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and Edinburgh, the Missouri Botanical Garden, the Harvard University Herbaria \& Libraries, Geneva Conservatory and Botanical Garden, the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, the South African Biodiversity Institute, the Australian National Botanic Gardens, and the Kunming Institute of Botany, just to name a few.

When it comes to botanical information, navigation in the ocean of scientific binomial names hiding the identity of a plant can be overwhelming. To alleviate this, I turned to a range of botanical databases for the purposes of correct identification, and information gathering. I used databases such as \gls{TPL} (\url{http://www.theplantlist.org}), which was recently superseded by the \gls{WFO} (\url{http://www.worldfloraonline.org}); the \gls{IPNI} (\url{http://www.ipni.org}); \gls{POWO} (\url{http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org}); the \gls{GBIF} (\url{https://www.gbif.org}); the \gls{FOC} hosted on eFloras (\url{http://www.efloras.org/index.aspx}) and the \gls{BHL} (\url{ https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/}). \gls{TPL} for instance claimed to be ``a working list of all known plant species'', now under \gls{WFO} it is ``an online flora of all known plants'' , and as such also connects different plant checklists and biodiversity databases using the nomenclatural and publishing information. In my dissertation I will frequently refer to \gls{POWO}, which contains botanical descriptions and geographic data (native and introduced habitat), besides the usual taxonomic and botanical information. 

In addition to online databases, I will occasionally also turn to reference books from the field of food technology and nutritional science, such as the \textit{Handbook of Herbs and Spices} \autocite{peter_handbook_2012,peter_handbook_2006}, and \textit{The Encyclopedia of Herbs \& Spices} \autocite{ravindran_encyclopedia_2017}. These encyclopedias, although aimed at chemistry-focused food industry professionals, also contain holistic information on the plant-based products and discuss the origins and vernacular names, besides the usual particulars on usage and medicinal qualities. It is also worth noting that various dictionaries usually mention the scientific names of plants.

Regarding traditional medicine systems, I frequently consulted modern inventories of \gls{TCM} to identify materials and extract Chinese names, including the the connecting databases of Hong Kong Baptist University: the HKBU Medicinal Plant Images Database\footnote{\url{https://library.hkbu.edu.hk/electronic/libdbs/mpd/index.html}}, the HKBU Chinese Medicinal Material Images Database\footnote{\url{https://library.hkbu.edu.hk/electronic/libdbs/mmd/index.html}} HKBU Chinese Medicine Specimen Database\footnote{\url{https://libproject.hkbu.edu.hk/was40/search?channelid=44273}}; and the PolyU Chinese Herbal Medicine Database\footnote{\url{https://herbaltcm.sn.polyu.edu.hk/}}. Armed with the botanical knowledge, we shall have an ideally clear picture on the spices, and a firm base to connect linguistic data to.

\subsection{Collecting and Annotating the Names}

In the second stage, I have collected the names of spices by combing through the published literature and online databases; whether botanical as described above, historical, or culinary. Always, prioritizing the existing linguistic and philological treatises, of course. I have linked the collected spice names to the respective spices and the result of this is an inventory of nearly 400 spice names that link to the initial set of 24 spices. For each spice, I tried to collect their names in the three languages, and it was also my goal to record where I have found these names. Therefore, thorough citations are available in the dataset pointing towards books, journal articles, databases, dictionaries, or sometimes even Wikipedia. As a preparatory step for the linguistic analysis, I have added some annotations. 

\subsubsection{Conventionalized Terms}

First and foremost, I have checked the words against dictionaries to see if their use is conventionalized or not, and I have marked words that appear in a dictionary. If a word occurs in multiple dictionaries, I only recorded the one that I deem the most authoritative or reliable, unless they are both extremely interesting entries or contradict each other.

\subsubsection{Present Status of the Terms}

Then, as an internal operational measure, I have assigned the names into categories regarding their lexicographic status as spice words: default, alias, historic, archaic, and obsolete. This was mostly for myself to better orientate after the terms started to accumulate, and I used the following scheme: ``Default'' marks the names the spices are mostly known today, they comprise the words that should be most commonly found in a dictionary, or most frequent in a corpus. These are the names what you see as section-headers in the thesis. This indicator is somewhat arbitrary, since there is no reason for one item not to have several equally relevant synonyms, but I needed to chose one main term to represent one spice. The reasons for this are the following: (1) I needed a convenient way to ``call'' each item, so they can be efficiently compared compared across the three languages. (2) I needed an identifying key for all the other names for the same spice, and (3) I wanted to avoid any possible confusion between item that have overlapping common names (i.e. pepper vs. pepper). The rationale behind the default set of names in further explained in \cref{ch:names} \nameref{ch:names}.

``Alias'' refers to any other current alternative name that a spice can be known by, regardless of popularity, context, or reason. For example, \textit{aniseed} is an alias for \textit{anise} (the default term). ``Historic'' refers to once important terms that were the at a certain point in history would have been considered default, and---due to their role and popularity in the past---still relevant today. This category especially includes cases where spice was attested under a different name from what it is known by now. ``Archaic'' refers to historic words that are rare and not relevant today, but still recognizable, and ``obsolete'' refers to names that are essentially dead. If a dictionary uses these remarks, (e.g., obsolete), I comply with the dictionary.
%Examples?
I have identified a few more cases that could be best characterized as ``speculative'', this refers to spice names that are not attested anywhere, and I assume them to be the author's invention/translation. % For example, 
% title: king of spices, queen of spice, black gold, red gold

I have highlighted the so-called default items as they also act as a keys or identifier (ID) to the rest of the alternative names corresponding to the same spice.

\subsubsection{Borrowed Terms}

Lastly, indicated if the name is a loanword or not, or whether it needs further checking. % Refer to loanword section,

\subsubsection{Meanings, Literal Meanings, Glosses}

For every term in Arabic or Chinese, I added a gloss, so the literal meanings could be decoded, and most names also have written notes and comments on their logic, formation, origin, or any other remarkable aspect. Sometimes a short explanation is needed to understand the emergence of a term, or the grounds for its existence. Soon, the dataset of spice names was populated with terms corresponding to the botanically informed binomial names and the materials they represent, and based on the information from stage one, the names were also annotated with the macro-areas of their native geographic origin.

% Before moving on to analyze this list of spice terminology...

\subsubsection{Attestation}

I have also recorded the details concerning attestation where available, noting a date, approximate date, century, and period (i.e. early Old English, Tang dynasty, etc.). For this information I used dates from the \gls{OED}, in English, and historical corpora for Arabic and Chinese where available. The source of the attestation dates are noted in the dataset. I have also tried to gather the pre-modern documents where each name was recorded, with the title and author of the historical works for future reference. % Topic? Medicine, religion, history, blabla.

%Estimation and guesses?

\subsection{Collecting Etymologies}

In the third stage, I have collected detailed etymological information on selected names: the terms that were marked as default. Doing so, I now have a parallel set of spice nomenclature of the three languages for 24 spices, and I can compare them in terms of borrowed status, and their etymological development and origins. Here as well, I have included a few other historically relevant terms.

\section{Sources}

\subsection{Primary Sources}

One core component of this study is philological research. Philology is the meticulous study of literary texts, primarily of historical documents, to study language, history, philosophy, literature, culture, religion, or any traditional knowledge of exceptional importance strongly connected to a society, primarily through the analysis of historic texts (sometimes written in now dead languages). Modern philological research relies on two types of sources: primary and secondary literature. Primary literature denotes historical texts, the so-called classics, for example, the already mentioned \textit{De Materia Medica} of the Greek physician Dioscorides (c. 40--90 \AD) \autocite{dioscorides_materia_2005}, books of Roman historians, such as Pliny the Elder (23/24--79 \AD) and his \textit{Naturalis Historia} \autocite{pliny_the_elder_natural_1855} are good examples, not to mention the or \nth{1}-century cookery book by Apicius \autocite{apicius_apicius_1977}. There also available \glspl{materia medica} from the Islamic scientific golden-age, such as the \gls{Qanun} \textit{[Canon of Medicine]} of Ibn Sina/Avicenna (980--1037) \autocite{ibn_sina_-qanun_1329} and fantastic miscellanies from the Tang dynasty era, such as the \gls{Youyang} \textit{[Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang]} from the \nth{9} century \autocite{yyzz}. Indeed, we must not forget the Bible or Quran, as they are also rich historical and linguistic sources for our topic. A number of these primary texts are available in their original form through museums' and libraries' online databases, as transcribed editions in historical corpora, and of course published English translations. A vast number of classical texts (Greek and Latin) can be accessed through the Perseus Digital Library \autocite{crane_perseus_nodate}. Critical editions of a classical text, such as that of the famous \gls{Periplus} by \textcite{casson_periplus_1989}, or \textcite{de_goeje_bibliotheca_1870}'s \textit{Bibliotheca Geographorum Arabicorum} series are also considered primary. Ancient and Classical dictionaries, such as the \gls{Shuowen}, or the \gls{Lisan} are also an integral part of philology. Secondary literature is everything else building on these works, monographs, histories reviewing a multitude of authentic texts, published in recent times.

% Also, research involving specialists from other field of science, such as the new archaeogenetics, pushing forward progress in biology and evolutionary linguistics can be related.



\subsection{Etymological Dictionaries}

Besides the literature itself discussed earlier, a core part of the philology component in this research are etymological dictionaries. Etymological thirst, the seeking of word origins was one of the cardinal thrills for early thinkers ever since Plato, and we will make use of the advances made in the past centuries. The \gls{OED} has detailed etymological information based on previous works on English and for other languages, a couple of works to be mentioned are for Greek \textcite{beekes_etymological_2010}, Hebrew, \textcite{klein_comprehensive_1987}, Old Chinese \textcite{schuessler_abc_2007} and Chinese \textcite{liu__1985}. Unfortunately, Arabic lacks an authoritative etymological dictionary for many reasons\footnote{For a brief overview on the matter, see \textcite{blazek_etymology_2006}}, but we can still turn to essential reference works such as the \textit{Encyclopaedia of Islam}\footnote{Limited access online at \url{https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/browse/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2}} \autocite{ei2} or the \textit{Encyclopaedia Iranica}\footnote{Accessible online at \url{https://iranicaonline.org/}} \autocite{eir}.

\begin{note}
    References to dictionary entries are made very frequently in this dissertation, and so I made the decision to use a compact way of citing dictionaries. Instead of following the standard APA \nth{7} guideline and referencing every entry separately, I will indicate the entry as a page number or headword and reference every dictionary just once. This would save us from the pain of reading (Oxford University Press, n.d.-a) (Oxford University Press, n.d.-b) (Oxford University Press, n.d.-c) and its endless permutations. This minor deviation from the APA style will make the number of dictionary entries in the bibliography less oppressive, and the running citations more reader-friendly. I will also use footnote citations whenever I reference a dictionary, and I stick to this practice throughout the dissertation to make reading more comfortable.
\end{note}

\section{Corpora}

The second major component of this study is corpus linguistics, and I will use corpora from three major languages: English, Arabic, and Chinese. I chose these languages for two reasons. One, they represent three influential civilizations in the history of spices, as well as powers actively participating in trade throughout history, each having its zenith at slightly different historical periods, as I described previously. 

For modern corpora, I will use the English Web 2020 (enTenTen20, circa 36.5 billion words), the Arabic Web 2012, preprocessed with the Stanford tagger (arTenTen12, ca. 7.5 billion words), and the Chinese Web 2017, Simplified version(zhTenTen17, ca. 13.5 billion words), all hosted on the \gls{SkE} (\url{https://www.sketchengine.eu/} \autocite{kilgarriff_sketch_2004,kilgarriff_sketch_2014}. Enormous web corpora such as the above contains billions of words, therefore I will certainly have enough instances even for spices more rare.

\begin{table}[]

    \end{tabularx}
    \caption[The list of corpora consulted in the thesis.]{The list of corpora consulted in the thesis.}
    \label{table:corpora}
\end{table}

In terms of historical corpora, I have consulted a few collections. For English, I relied on the \gls{EHBC} (EEBO, ECCO, Evans) hosted on the Sketch Engine, that is around 826 million words and contains books published between 1473--1820, with a vast majority written around 1600. English also has a good coverage on the Google Books project ??. For Arabic, I have settled on using the \gls{KSUCCA}, which is around 47 million words containing literature on various genres between the 7-\nth{11} centuries, ranging from books on medicine, geography, law, history, and religious texts \autocite{alrabiah_design_2013,alrabiah_empirical_2014}. As for Chinese, I have frequented the \gls{CTP} \autocite{sturgeon_chinese_nodate,sturgeon_chinese_2021} which has base of 25 million characters pre-modern Chinese documents, not including the community edited texts. I also used the \gls{SS} (around 754 million words), containing classics ranging from ancient times up until 1949 \autocite{academia_sinica_scripta_1993}; the \gls{QTS} [Tang poetry collection], which contains around 48,900 poems; and the \gls{CBETA} project, which contains the Chinese Buddhist Canon, also known as the Chinese Tripitaka \autocite[365-386]{chen_buddhism_1964}. Thus, accommodating textual heritage from ancient times up until the 20th century.

%  3. Methods
%  The methods of the present study can be divided into two main components, along the lines of the two main objectives. Objective A, exploring the “diffusion of spices” will involve classical philological research, augmented with the help of historical corpora, while Objective B, exploring the “language of spices” will use corpus linguistic methods.
%  3.1. Exploration
%  Before setting out on a philological journey or diving into corpora for massive data collecting adventures, we must clarify what we want to collect data about, and how we are going to compare spices and spice-words. This dissertation being a linguistic study, the words/names and their meanings pertaining to spices, the “semantics of spices” seems to be an appropriate point of commencement. Spicy word senses
%  We decided to choose word senses as the basis of comparison, and we will collect semantic data from lexical databases, such as the WordNet 3.1, also known as the Princeton WordNet of English (PWN)16 (Fellbaum, 1998; Miller, 1995), the Open Multilingual Wordnet (OMW)17 (Bond & Paik, 2012), and the Extended Open Multilingual Wordnet 1.2 (EOMW)18 (Bond & Foster, 2013). Wordnets map semantic relations between words. These semantic networks clarify multiple senses of a word and help us identify meanings useful for our investigation.
%  For example, the word `clove' has seven meanings, four as a noun and three as a verb. Three of the nominal meanings refer to Syzygium aromaticum---the fragrant tree native to the Moluccas, once also known as the Spice Islands---and the remaining one represents the cloves of a garlic (#3, not a cognate word). See Figure 3 below for an overview of the relations between the clove tree (#2), its fresh flower bud (#1), and the dried form of the bud used as a spice, whole or ground (#4).
